It is hard to imagine a more perfect item to have in your GoPro collection. I use it nearly every time I attach a GoPro to a new mount. At first I thought I would have like the handle to be longer, but the length prevents over torquing the screw. They thought of everything. Best of all - my cameras stay where I want them.

R3R9EHY6WO0EMK	4	Save your thumbs. Use this instead.	For the parts of your rig that need to be locked down and immovable, this is essential.<br /><br />I don't know how long the finish will last because I chipped it opening bottles. If you are in a salt-water environment, this might be more of an issue. I like the closed end, which keeps the wrench from sliding towards the camera rig when tightening.<br /><br />I'd like it even better if there was a flat-blade screwdriver/prybar included	2015-08-28	1470	For the parts of your rig that need to be locked down and<br>immovable, this is essential.<br /><br />I don't know how long<br>the finish will last because I chipped it opening bottles.

R2R0BCJHCTH6KN	4	The Handler is a good product but needs improvements	The Handler is a good tool but needs some minor improvement. It will do what I want and that is keeping my Go Pro from sinking in water by keeping it afloat, although that has not happened yet. However, it is not compatible with the quick release mounts. You have to take it off any other mount you are using and physically use the screw mount, which takes more time, which could come in the loss of losing a video by not being able to do a quick change to another mount. Go Pro or some third party vendor needs to make a quick release mount for The Handler.	2015-08-28	1470	The Handler is a good tool but needs some minor improvement.

Might last the day. Might not. Can't replace the batter either. Must charge via a proprietary USB dongle. The USB side of the dongle has the largest, most inflexible USB plug ever. It's straight out of some operator board in the 40s.	2015-08-28	1470	This is the fastest way to make sure your GroPro is working and<br>best if you don't want to move the rig from pressing on the<br>shutter button.<br /><br />It has a much more reliable<br>connection than the app.<br /><br />The only downside is a<br>pitiful battery life.

R1BF7IF1DV86IQ	4	Good, not perfect	Overall, I think this works pretty good. But its tough to get it tight enough, even on a big dog, to keep it from falling off the back of the dog when they swim. The first time my dog swam with it, the dog came back without the GoPro and Fetch harness. Luckily, the harness and camera had fallen off right as the dog was getting out of the water, so I was able to retrieve it. After testing in a pool the next time, I was able to figure out how tight it needed to be to keep it securely on the dog, which was wayyyy tighter than I thought would be comfortable for the dog. The straps just have a lot of stretch in them, so you really have to crank down on them, past the point where it appears to be tight.	2015-08-21	1477	Overall, I think this works pretty good.

I also didn't hesitate to let go of it when I needed a free hand to climb into the dive boat because the lanyard would fit tightly around my wrist with the sliding adjuster.  Even if it had slipped off my rest, it floats!<br /><br />Wish the handle was a little longer or came as a telescopic handle.	2015-08-21	1477	Nice floating handle for GoPro.

R34W7A1RKUCZPD	3	Good suction cup but lacks real versatility	I bought this mount in my search for the perfect suction cup mount for my GoPro.  I have found in some cases GoPro has really gotten the design of their accessories right, and in other cases they are a little off the mark.  This is one of those latter cases.<br /><br />First off, the suction cup works well.  It is very similar to the mount I ended up selecting to use with my GoPro, and locks securely in place on any smooth, clean surface.  If that is the extent of your requirements, this mount will make you happy at a reasonable price point.<br /><br />Where this mount falls short is its adherence to the notion that folks only might want to adjust their shots in 90 degree increments.  All of the GoPro extension arms use fixed elbows instead of ball joints, which can be just as secure.  Since you can't rotate a suction cup after it is mounted, a ball joint extension arm would really do the trick here.  Ultimately, I replaced this mount with one that offers that option and I couldn't be happier.  I cannot imagine wrestling with this mount in some of the arrangements that my other suction mount handles with ease.<br /><br />Overall, this mount beats basic ball joint style mounts on price and extension arm range (most of the basic ball joint mounts have very short arms), but a more complete ball joint mount kit satisfies a wider variety of scenarios.	2015-08-20	1478	I bought this mount in my search for the perfect suction cup<br>mount for my GoPro.

R1L0XA5KGQQE98	4	I've seen a number of knockoffs and aftermarket versions of mounts that simply don't attach to the GoPro very well or otherwise	This package includes two mounts: a regular tripod mount, and a quick release version.<br /><br />Let's talk about the package price first. Yes, ten bucks for two mounts is somewhat expensive. However, I've seen a number of knockoffs and aftermarket versions of mounts that simply don't attach to the GoPro very well or otherwise break when you look at them funny, and the official GoPro mounts never seem to suffer from these same issues (though it's hard for me to believe the GoPro mounts are using &#34;better plastic&#34; or something). By the same token, for the same price you can get aluminum mounts as well, but they are functionally not any different. Especially for the regular tripod mount, I'd stick with the official GoPro version because none of the aftermarket companies could ever seem to get the 3-prongs that connect to GoPro housings right.<br /><br />There's not much to say about the regular tripod mount. It has a circular base with a 1/4&#34; tripod screw adapter for you to put on top of tripods, rails, or any number of selfie sticks and poles.<br /><br />The real unique part about this package is the quick release base, and that is the real reason you would pay for this package over just getting the regular tripod mount. Self explanatory, but with this base you can quickly swap your GoPro from tripod mount to another mount very quickly, rather than fiddling with the thumbscrew, saving tons of time particularly when you're actually in the middle of filming something. This also gives you more options if you need to tilt the GoPro at a certain angle or use additional accessories like the GoPro pivot arm, J-hook mount or extension arms. The quick release base also has two 1/4&#34; tripod screw adapters underneath, so you can either place it center on a tripod or slightly forward/backward for better fit or balance. This is actually a rather unique piece, as I have not seen the aftermarket really try to duplicate it, and it's useful enough that I would recommend buying this package over just getting the regular tripod mount.d buying this package over just getting the regular tripod mount.	2015-08-12	1486	This package includes two mounts: a regular tripod mount, and a<br>quick release version.<br /><br />Let's talk about the package<br>price first.

It turns out that I stuck it to the wrong one, so I couldn't get it on the waterproof casing for my Hero3-White, and now it is totally useless.

R1KHHAEV0MZZTN	3	Good quality, poorly installed adhesive on the float	I went for GoPro's original float door due to trust issues on aftermarket products in high surf and I was not disappointed. I liked the fact that they include a replacement door you can devote to the float thing. However, I was left very disappointed since the 3M adhesive pad was very poorly centred on the float. This is not a trivial issue since such bad centring limits the position in which you can stick the float to the backdoor and therefore the accessibility of the latching mechanism. It would be better if the adhesive pad came uninstalled.	2015-07-29	1500	I went for GoPro's original float door due to trust issues on<br>aftermarket products in high surf and I was not disappointed.

R36C0AU4P9MNAC	1	Great Idea but needs Improvement.	1. My Bella rolls on her back and the straps come undone. The straps don't have buckles, they all just slide in a nylon loop on a open buckle.<br />2. With the camera under her neck, the GoPro hits her legs while she runs. She was walking funny and you can hear it hitting her legs. She was not comfortable. Her collar and Dog Tag hit the camera when she runs and especially when I have a leash on her.<br />3 With the GoPro on top it leans over because the camera is so high.<br />Videos I did get looked pretty cool. It shakes a lot when she runs. Which is expected. This was at the Dog Beach so she's constantly running or sniffing butts.<br />The straps again are a poor design and they are stretchy. They loosen up after a bit.<br />Would be nice if it had a harness buckle on the back for a leash. Gets caught on a collar leash.	2015-07-28	1501	1.

It shakes a lot when she runs. Which is<br>expected. This was at the Dog Beach so she's constantly running<br>or sniffing butts.<br />The straps again are a poor design and<br>they are stretchy. They loosen up after a bit.<br />Would be<br>nice if it had a harness buckle on the back for a leash. Gets<br>caught on a collar leash.

You might look a bit goofy running around with the headstrap mount on your head but it works great and you don't have to worry about losing your GoPro camera.  I would say this is a must have item for every GoPro owner.	2015-07-28	1501	Got a second one just for the Quick Clip.

R3B89SFPWVR7ZV	5	GoPro Suction Cup Mount Works Great!	"REVIEW 7/23<br /><br />This suction cup mount (fig1) is great. It comes with many parts, so you are able to change how tall the camera is mounted and what angle as well. The suction cup was bigger than I expected, but I thought it would be a good thing because it would hold much stronger. The diameter of the suction cup mount is approximately 3 1/2 inches, just an educated guess.<br /><br />So the mounting system is pretty easy, yet extremely strong. There is a circular \\""Press\\"" button in the middle of the base, and you set your suction cup mount on your surface and press that down. Then, there is a \\""Lock\\"" lever over the \\""Press\\"" button, and you push that down after you push the \\""Press\\"" button (fig2). That secures the suction cup firmly to your surface, as long as it is decently clean and flat. I set mine on my countertop, and shook it around a lot. It moved a little bit, but not as much as one of those cheaper non-GoPro suction cup mounts would. So I'd say this is worth the cost.<br /><br />The mount has bolts that screw and tighten to hold the different parts of the mount together. Also, if you look at my pictures, in the one with everything taken apart, there is a screw that is below my GoPro. This is one of my own screws from another GoPro mount, and it will be needed if you want to use the small piece to the right of the GoPro (fig3). There are also parts that you can attach that use the clip attachment like what came with your GoPro out of the box (fig4). Any and all of the pieces that came with this suction cup mount are very easy to attach and detach from the mount, and are very sturdy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have not taken this mount out for a test, but I will have an update very soon with more information about the quality of this product. (See below review update + videos)<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say that this mount is very, very sturdy, and is totally worth the cost. You would rather get this mount for more money and have better quality videos and not lose your GoPro and your mount, rather than buy the cheaper version of this that is very shaky, not as strong, and much more of a possibility of losing your expensive camera and your mount, all because you wanted a cheaper, less reliable suction cup mount. It's a really great mount!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/25/15<br /><br />So I took this suction cup mount out for a test drive today, and it worked out great. I was really nervous to try it out, but it held up really well and it was pretty sturdy. I used a damp towel to clean off the surface I would mount it to, then mounted the suction cup while the surface was still slightly damp. It worked well! The video below (fig5) shows my GoPro Hero4 Silver on the suction cup mount on top of my car. It held up really well at up to 90 mph (145 kmph) on top of the car! Unfortunately, I still had the waterproof door on, so the audio quality was not as good as it could have been. On the bright side though, I got this in 4K resolution!<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: THE VIDEOS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE DUE TO THE STUPIDITY OF MY EDITING SOFTWARE. ONCE I GET THE SOFTWARE WORKING AGAIN FOR ANOTHER $50, I WILL POST THE VIDEOS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. FOR NOW, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ MY REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT UNTIL I POST THE VIDEOS.

My dog is also white and the black dye rubbed off on her, I didn't care much because she has short hair and bath time isn't too tedious. I will continue to use the harness, I just would not recommend allowing your dog out of sight or in water in the event the harness falls off.	2015-07-25	1504	I've used this a handful of times on my dog.

When removed after about an hour of use, it felt just as secure as when I first put it on.<br /><br />I also have an inexpensive suction cup mount that came with one of those accessory bundles and there's no way I would ever use that one in any place except a stationary, zero risk environment.<br /><br />Overall, this mount really sucks -- as it should.	2015-07-23	1506	This suction cup mount really does a nice job with my GoPro<br>Hero4 Silver.

R2FQ8SF9UKXKO5	5	Essential part of my Go Pro kit	If you like to tighten everything by hand and feel secure doing that, then move on. However, if you want to be 100% sure that your new expensive Go Pro stays where it's supposed to, then you need this tool. Its got a solid metal construction (minus the actual grooves) and has a good weight. The bottle opener is a plus, and the hole so you can keep it on a keychain is a nice addition. If you have a Go Pro, you should have this tool. Point blank period. Recommended!	2015-07-23	1506	If you like to tighten everything by hand and feel secure doing<br>that, then move on.

R2NUQUVPCRFPWN	5	Essential for professionals	If your a filmmaker and have a camera besides the Go Pro, these 2 pieces are extremely essential in being able to use all your other film equipment you've invested in with your Go Pro. The quick release plate is secure, my camera's not going anywhere. I wish it came with the actual quick release mount that attaches to the Go Pro, but luckily I got one with a different kit I purchased. I use these with my tripod, monopod, slider, skate dolly, even my steadicam. Well worth the money.

R16TFR3XVHUFDE	5	Do the float test.	before you take your gopro out on the water be sure to do a Float test on it. that means going in shallow water and dropping it, this way you will know if it will sink or float in the deeper water as well. this will hold up the gopro when attached to the short suction cup, but really anything larger and it will still sink. the amount it can hold is going to be different for different situations, just make sure to test it out first.	2015-07-23	1506	before you take your gopro out on the water be sure to do a<br>Float test on it. that means going in shallow water and dropping<br>it, this way you will know if it will sink or float in the<br>deeper water as well. this will hold up the gopro when attached<br>to the short suction cup, but really anything larger and it will<br>still sink. the amount it can hold is going to be different for<br>different situations, just make sure to test it out first.

R2E3HU93M1YIFM	1	Did not work after first charge	Simply put: it would not work.  The user manual says to charge it overnight before using.  Just as the batteries of the GoPro.  When I took it out of the package, it displayed information on the LCD screen, but I left it charging until the morning before trying to do anything with it.  In the morning, the GoPro batteries were charged and my camera was working beautifully.  The remote was dead.  Would not turn on.  Charged it on a different computer USB port.  Still dead.  Called GoPro and waited 26 minutes listening to music.  Good thing I got this on amazon and can return for a full refund.  I guess I will have to work with my iPhone to control the camera instead.	2015-07-22	1507	Simply put: it would not work.  The user manual says to charge<br>it overnight before using.

R1J439F43MA013	5	Easy-to-Spot and Buoyant!	The float is ideal for use on jet skis or watersports. Used it today for lake surfing with a wrist mount, and took it off and let it float for a moment to make sure I wasn't going to be in a panic if anything breaks with the mount. Floats perfectly and is super-bright, in case it were to come off it would be easy to spot in the dark water. I wish that it came with some instructions on suggesting exactly where to place the adhesive float. When I placed it on mine, I did it a little too high and it makes it difficult to close the latch on the waterproof case. I have to pull the float back a little bit while I close the door. Other than that, the float works great and I hope I never have to rely on it, but I know that if I do need to rely on it I'll be glad it's there.	2015-07-22	1507	The float is ideal for use on jet skis or watersports.

It's a great concept and probably would work well if you can screw the screw in all the way on the quick release or on the head strap itself.  The screw does not go in all the way like the screws do i my other Go pro products.  There is quite a gap for screw to be flush and tight, so the Go Pro camera falls down easily.  I can look straight ahead and the camera slowly go forward to a downward result.  Very disappointed and I thought maybe it was a fluke but I see others with same issue.  This should not be a purchase of chance where some get faulty headstraps and others get ones that work.

Handler Review<br /><br />DON'T BUY FLIMSY PRODUCT - BREAKS WAY TOO EASILY.  I noticed that this product also has other several bad reviews because of this problem.  The &#34;ears&#34; of this product broke within about a month of owning this product.  In addition, the ears being so flimsy on the handler also caused the ears of my brand new go pro housing to break.  I was on vacation in Hawaii.  Within the first week of filming with this system the handler ears broke and in the second week the go pro housing ears cracked.  First one go pro housing ear cracked then both broke clean off.  Thankfully it broke completely on my last day when I was finished filming sea turtles and fish on South Coast Kauai just a few hours before I had to make my way back to the airport.  If this would have happened earlier in my trip, it would have been a real bummer with the time spent and hassle of trying to find a replacement. Good and secure mounts are more important than many may initially think.  The scariest part is that you could actually lose your whole GoPro Camera with this defect. I think the key to using this product also is not to over tighten the screw.  If you don't tighten it enough, however, the camera does flop around, which obviously you don't want. Also when you press record you should hold the housing of the camera.  When you push the record button with only one hand holding only the handle (and not also holding the housing) it puts A LOT OF STRESS on those little plastic handler ears.  A camera user shouldn't have to go through so many hoops to properly use a product.  Clearly, this is BAD DESIGN.  It's too bad the ears of this product are so flimsy.  Before it broke, the product otherwise worked great since it floats, is lightweighet, has a strap and has a comfortable grip.  I used it everywhere on my vacation.  Hiking, kayaking, snorkeling and even in a doors off helicopter ride.  This mount should be for an ACTION CAMERA.  So, I am surprised it was not designedwith more durability and ruggedness that the GoPro brand is typically known for.  Since it has been over a month of purchase, it appears I cannot return this item via Amazon, however, I am hoping that GoPro will work with me in trying to get this replaced.  If not, I likely will just by another product.  Really GoPro needs to redesign this product. Use a more durable and stiffer material for the ears part of the product.  The rest of the product could still be made out of plastic to keep the weight light and proper buoyancy for water use.  This product experience been very disappointing since a defect in one product caused two products to break (the handler AND my new GoPro Housing.	2015-07-19	1510	Handler Review<br /><br />DON'T BUY FLIMSY PRODUCT - BREAKS WAY<br>TOO EASILY.

So, I am surprised it was not designedwith<br>more durability and ruggedness that the GoPro brand is typically<br>known for.  Since it has been over a month of purchase, it<br>appears I cannot return this item via Amazon, however, I am<br>hoping that GoPro will work with me in trying to get this<br>replaced.  If not, I likely will just by another product.<br>Really GoPro needs to redesign this product. Use a more durable<br>and stiffer material for the ears part of the product.  The rest<br>of the product could still be made out of plastic to keep the<br>weight light and proper buoyancy for water use.  This product<br>experience been very disappointing since a defect in one product<br>caused two products to break (the handler AND my new GoPro<br>Housing.

R1KSDAM1S2X9AB	5	"Works Good for ""Road Forward"" Thru Windshield Car Footage"	Very happy with this mount, this is one of the best GoPro accessories, it is very secure and does not shake. Have used this mount plus GoPro for several years with my convertible to record the more picturesque on-the-road portions of vacations and car rallies I have been in, including several OpenAir Classics in Wisconsin and two Porsche Parades. I have even taken it to Europe and have some cool footage of Rothenberg-O-T. I usually mount my camera on the inside of the windshield and use a circular polarizer to eliminate internal reflections. Other mounts and cameras I have tried have too much low frequency vibration to work well. I position the mount carefully using a level and the LCD display accessory so that I don't have to use the extra axis adapters as I find that for road forward filming, these are unnecessary and can add some shake to the picture. I also find that The &#34;narrow&#34; 1080 setting on the Hero 3+ works well for my road forward shots. Have not tried low angle front tire shots yet due to lack of time and angst about losing the camera....	2015-07-13	1516	Very happy with this mount, this is one of the best GoPro<br>accessories, it is very secure and does not shake.

I<br>usually mount my camera on the inside of the windshield and use<br>a circular polarizer to eliminate internal reflections. Other<br>mounts and cameras I have tried have too much low frequency<br>vibration to work well. I position the mount carefully using a<br>level and the LCD display accessory so that I don't have to use<br>the extra axis adapters as I find that for road forward filming,<br>these are unnecessary and can add some shake to the picture. I<br>also find that The &#34;narrow&#34; 1080 setting on the Hero 3+<br>works well for my road forward shots. Have not tried low angle<br>front tire shots yet due to lack of time and angst about losing<br>the camera....

R25W8SFW87EJNG	5	Protect You GoPro	I purchased this accessory for my GoPro before heading on an exotic vacation.  This worked so well in the ocean (I had to test it right)!  It arrived as described and was easy to attach to the camera.  The floaty adheres to the backdoor that comes with it using some 3M adhesives.  It is a really great addition to the GoPro family!  I love it and if you think you will be in the water, protect your investment and get one of the floaty backs!  You will not be disappointed!	2015-07-13	1516	I purchased this accessory for my GoPro before heading on an<br>exotic vacation.  This worked so well in the ocean (I had to<br>test it right)!

Also, seams don't look to be very reliable, and I wouldn't trust them under a continuous stress.	2015-07-12	1517	Pros - an essential tool for an all around GoPro shooting.

R1MUBPGAMF6WTQ	4	Great accessory for many uses	In all honesty I haven't used this as a floaty yet so I cannot attest to that aspect, however I have been religiously using it as a simple monopod for steady video footage on rides at Disneyland. Works perfectly for how I've been using it. Very secure, have never felt unsteady about it. High quality material also, feels very sturdy. Highly recommend it for any use, it's worth having in your GoPro accessory box for sure.	2015-06-30	1529	In all honesty I haven't used this as a floaty yet so I cannot<br>attest to that aspect, however I have been religiously using it<br>as a simple monopod for steady video footage on rides at<br>Disneyland.

R13CEP3RUVJKK7	5	One of my favorite accessories - an absolute must for powersports.	Easy to pair with the camera, works perfectly from far distances, and easy to understand. The velcro wrist strap isn't exactly comfortable or contoured but it does the job. It's also pricey but if you are doing anything with powersports, which requires multiple people to get the best shots, or camera positions that aren't exactly convenient to get to in order to capture the shot, you need this accessory.<br /><br />Only negative is the wireless setting on the camera. You only have to pair the camera to the remote one time, but depending on how you use the camera the wireless mode on the camera will go back to &#34;off&#34; and you will have to turn it back on every time you use the remote. Annoying, but doable. After pairing, if you do not turn the wireless back on the remote will just search and search for the camera non-stop but never find it.	2015-06-29	1530	Easy to pair with the camera, works perfectly from far<br>distances, and easy to understand.

R12M4WLIWTICSL	5	Glad I got one before they disappear forever	I tried a cheaper model that simply didn't work, but because I intend to use my camera as a helmet cam, it was wise to buy one that has an external mic.  I'm never going underwater for shots, but I needed the protective case for my camera.  I drilled a series of holes until the mic will barely go through the hole to the mic connection.  It still gives the camera water resistance, and good enough for me.  You do have to buy an authentic GoPro Mic strap for the Hero3 to use an aftermarket mic.	2015-06-26	1533	I tried a cheaper model that simply didn't work, but because I<br>intend to use my camera as a helmet cam, it was wise to buy one<br>that has an external mic.

Very good, floats like a charm and very good handgrip for everyday use (way better than the wrist mount)!<br /><br />Sadly, one day I found the hinge where you attach the camera broken (missing one of the three parts), so I had buy another one. Since I can't know exactly what caused it to brake I cannot blame GoPro for poor quality because someone could have stepped on it or something, but I wish the hinge would be made of metal instead of plastic. For the price, though, I recommend this product.	2015-06-17	1542	Very good, floats like a charm and very good handgrip for<br>everyday use (way better than the wrist mount)!<br /><br<br>/>Sadly, one day I found the hinge where you attach the camera<br>broken (missing one of the three parts), so I had buy another<br>one.

Applied this to my gopro 4 black backdoor went in the ocean for literally 1 minute here in san diego to surf and my gopro came off my horrible wrist mount as I went under part of a wave and it then never surfaced. 1 hour of searching the water and another hour after dark with a flash light hoping it would come ashore as the tide went down and nothing. I was lucky enough to get a great deal on Craigslist for new gopro 4 black 2 months back, but now $450 of an investment in a decent camera is somewhere in the pacific.

There is something loose in the nut on the mount and no thumbs crew will tighten the camera on all the way.... so basically the camera was loose and facing the ground the whole ride home.

R301RDLUEULI9U	5	It definitely served it's purpose for that as it floats and has an easy to hold grip and sturdy wristband	We bought this before our snorkeling trip in Iceland, since I didn't want to accidentally drop the camera and have it fall to the bottom of 100 foot deep underwater canyon. It definitely served it's purpose for that as it floats and has an easy to hold grip and sturdy wristband. It really came in handy for the whole trip though, even out of the water. It's a great substitute for a 'selfie stick' as you can use it to hold the camera just a little bit further out than you otherwise could, and with the GoPro's wide angle lens this is more than sufficient to get everything in the picture!. It's also small enough to easily fit in a coat pocket or a purse.	2015-06-03	1556	We bought this before our snorkeling trip in Iceland, since I<br>didn't want to accidentally drop the camera and have it fall to<br>the bottom of 100 foot deep underwater canyon.

If you have the LCD backpack (Which i use religiously) it will not work.  Blocks the back view, obviously.  Also, better for shallow diving and snorkeling.  If you go too deep, the floaty foam collapses and will not work due to the underwater pressure (I read its like below 50 or 60 feet underwater).  Anyway, works well otherwise.	2015-05-23	1567	My gopro will never drown!  If you are a diver in need of never<br>losing your gopro underwater.  this is the way to go.

It came in a zip lock bag inside of a small white box. Definitely not genuine. Also it was labeled as a roll bar mount,that was also incorrect. It was quite apparent that it was way undersized for any type of roll bar/roll cage piping. I'm pretty certain they packaged a handle bar mount and labeled it as a roll bar. Do yourself a favor and just spend the $30 on a gopro mount straight from gopro.	2015-05-22	1568	I purchased this based off of the answered questions stating<br>that this was genuine gopro.

R182K5ECSWWJY9	4	Works awesome - if you aren't too tall.	Works great with one exception. So it straps to your head or your hat great. The only thing that doesn't work great is the perspective of the GoPro if you are 6'3&#34; tall.<br /><br />The reason is pretty simple, and I just wish I had realized it before purchasing. This places the camera about 2&#34; above your eyes. So for me it makes the video from the perspective of someone 6'5&#34; or 6'6&#34; tall. Add in the fisheye lens, and you've got a weird perspective. I would recommend this to anyone 5'10&#34; or shorter. It would also be great for children.	2015-05-18	1572	Works great with one exception. So it straps to your head or<br>your hat great.

For the whopping price of $70 you get an overpriced remote that your smart phone with a GoPro app can easily do. The reason why I bought this because I wanted to use this instead of using the app especially when traveling internationally. Don't get me wrong, it works well, but it is way to overpriced. The buttons work exactly how they work on the actual GoPro. It is pretty light weight and somewhat durable. Overall, I would not really recommend this to anyone if they dnt use it for international travel. I would recommend this for people who travel internationally, want to take pics in the water, or who want to use it during adventurous activities and do not want to risk breaking your phone.	2015-05-14	1576	A $70 remote?!

R2WWILZOYKFPJE	5	Makes your Gropro much more versatile.	A simple fitting you don't get with the camera but should. I have a walking stick that I've drilled and tapped a 1/4-20 hole in the top and this fitting allows me to mount the camera just above my hand where I can flip the camera around for a selfie video or to take a ground level or over the edge shot using the stick as a boom. The mount is made to the same standards as OEM and connects to the Gopro stuff I have and accepts the standard bolt that came with the camera. Good price, free shipping 😊	2015-04-25	1595	A simple fitting you don't get with the camera but should.

R30KSV1QJUHKG3	2	Worried about losing my camera	I bought this to mount my GoPro Hero 3 on my microlight trike aircraft, but tightening down the bolts bends the brackets so much I worry about them snapping and my camera plummeting to the ground to its ultimate demise. I ended up tightening just enough to hold, and then running a few zip ties around everything as an extra precaution. Further, the bolts aren't enclosed in the brackets. While this allows for easy on-off, if one gets loose from vibration, the whole thing can come off. Ok for non-critical applications, but next time I'll get something more solid.

However, a wrist lanyard is safer and it doesn't block the screen. The build quality is good, the adhesive stuff sticks to anything, and it looks good. If you use it for scuba diving, expect that it'll turn into a raisin and provide zilch buoyancy at depth, but that's probably for the best.<br /><br />If you have a hollow pole, note that the GoPro may be buoyant when you first get in but may start sinking later.	2015-04-22	1598	This works pretty well if you're snorkeling or doing other stuff<br>at the surface and as long as your pole and other accessories<br>aren't too heavy.

R1LS0YSR74FGW4	4	Not perfect... but still pretty good.	There are a lot of people that complain about the shakiness of their videos.  Well, it's on a dog.... you have to expect that a little.  However, I find shooting videos at higher frame rates and rendering them in slower motion makes them much more enjoyable. Yeah it's always going to be a little shaking looking... but again, dog videos.  The straps stay put as long as I secure them correctly.... it probably helps that I check them every so often and pull at them just to make sure.  It's not a perfect get up but it can work.  I personally enjoy using mine with the pooch.<br /><br />Some footage shot at the beach.....<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgC56Eh5uiA	2015-04-19	1601	There are a lot of people that complain about the shakiness of<br>their videos.

R2FATACEZUT28C	3	It's good, but limited.	This mount has given me good shots of walking and around and occasional swimming, but the reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because if you jump in the water from a tall height it will come off. Also if you want to try diving into the water with it, you're going to get a hard whack in the face. Tried to do flips with it and it seems any type of upside down action causes this little contraption to slip right off. Like if you bought the wrong condom size.<br /><br />If you get this mount for beach activities or anything swimming related, get the gopro float thing. It's orange and carries your gopro to the top of you drop it.	2015-04-11	1609	This mount has given me good shots of walking and around and<br>occasional swimming, but the reason why I am giving it 3 stars<br>is because if you jump in the water from a tall height it will<br>come off.

R356UJ40GOGGBU	3	I don't recommend.	It looks nice and everything, but the tool is very difficult not to slip from hand! I mean when you try to tighten or un-tighten the screw, it just doesn't perfectly rest and grab the knob, no, it has to jump, so it takes time to get it right. I understand this may be intentional so you don't over tighten the screws and end up breaking stuff but it is annoying for someone who knows what he is doing. I will stick to my Swiss knife!	2015-03-31	1620	It looks nice and everything, but the tool is very difficult not<br>to slip from hand!

Had no issues, easy to hold for a hour plus dive and with the tether if I needed to drop the camera I knew it would still be attached to me. It would be great if it was a little longer so I didn't need to get close to the reef or fish to get a shot and had a remote shutter, But for a consumer camera and a non professional diver or photographer it worked great.	2015-03-22	1629	Great addon to the GoPro for diving.

R1IPKA93JDV3EQ	5	Could not recommend this more.	I seriously didn't think I would ever get this. Didn't think I would need it because I have my phone. However, the size of my phone got bigger and it was a bit difficult to use one handedly. I bought this with a gift card because I refused to spend that much on a tiny remote. I wish I bought this sooner. As soon as you set it up, it will stay automatically connected to your camera when you have wifi mode on. I find it easier to use the remote when switching though settings. Having this attached to the selfie stick is a dream. I don't have to bust out the phone, get it connected to the wifi (which takes a while sometimes), I can just turn it on and start shooting.

However, the size of my<br>phone got bigger and it was a bit difficult to use one handedly.<br>I bought this with a gift card because I refused to spend that<br>much on a tiny remote.

RTKQVR1K70AWH	1	Headstrap and camera at bottom of Hanalua Bay	I have been open water swimming on my vacations to Hawaii and decided to try to record some of the sea life (mostly turtles but plenty of mantas and an occasional reef shark) as well as the beautiful reefs and fish I see during my swims. The headstrap and a snorkel seemed the best way to do this without having the image swing wildly each time I took a breath. On my first time trying the headstrap I swam out into Honalua Bay but the water was so murky visibility was nil. Seeking clearer waters I swam toward the mouth of the bay but when visibility didn't improve after about 100 yards or so I reached up to turn off the camera and to my horror found the entire rig, head strap and camera, were gone. Because I still felt the strap for my goggles I did not feel the headstrap for the GoPro slip off. I had no idea when it and I had parted company and because visibility was zero there was no way to go back and look for it. Evidently the bay is always murky in March and it remained so until I flew home a week later without my GoPro. Looks like some lucky snorkeler will find a nice treasure when the water clears up.	2015-03-11	1640	I have been open water swimming on my vacations to Hawaii and<br>decided to try to record some of the sea life (mostly turtles<br>but plenty of mantas and an occasional reef shark) as well as<br>the beautiful reefs and fish I see during my swims.

R1X0ZAC3BNP4O7	4	Good Buy	I have used this a few times while diving, and it has worked very well for me.  I usually free dive, so I have not tested the 10 m depth limit, but I can't see anything that would make it not work.  It might be that the pressure compresses the foam and decrease buoyancy.  The wrist strap makes it even more secure, so you will have a really hard time losing your camera, even it you are surfing.  The one downside that I have found with this is that because the core is hard plastic, it amplifies underwater noise, giving all my videos a loud hum.  Usually there is nothing worth hearing underwater anyway, so it is not that big of a deal.  Overall I am happy with this purchase.	2015-03-10	1641	I have used this a few times while diving, and it has worked<br>very well for me.

R39MFR94L18LCY	4	Good Buy	I got one of these to attach my camera to my tow rope for water skiing.  This holds really secure even when it goes in the water at 35+ MPH.

The description says you can set it to three different angles, but that refers to a vertical tilt.	2015-03-10	1641	I got one of these to attach my camera to my tow rope for water<br>skiing.

R1ITNYOIL6XBP7	5	Worth It	Whenever you swim in cold water, the moisture in the air inside the case condenses on the cold lens.  To prevent this need some kind of desiccant to absorb the moisture.  These do a great job, and I use these inserts multiple time (much more than the 4 that the review says).  The newer go pro cases have a slot for this to fit in, but you could use these with any waterproof case.  Well worth it if you are doing any kind of underwater work.  You don't want to finish your day of diving and realize that everything is foggy.	2015-03-09	1642	Whenever you swim in cold water, the moisture in the air inside<br>the case condenses on the cold lens.

Now, I got the iphone go pro app to connect with minimal effort.  But this, well, I gave up. I figure if I have to start reading message boards and online tips, etc, to get it to work, then I usually just don't deal with it.  I still have it and may try again later after I have forgotten how frustrating it was the first time.<br /><br />I read the instructions a few times to make sure I was doing it correctly.  So I did give it a good try.	2015-03-06	1645	I can't use the words that I want to use for this in a public<br>review.  I could not get it to sync with my Go Pro Hero 4<br>Silver.

An advice is that make sure you put the floaty on the correct door. Two doors comes with the floaty. One for the older model and one for the new model. Be sure it is the correct one because once you attach the adhesive you can't take it off.	2015-03-03	1648	This is a very useful tool for your gopro. It works for any go<br>pro aswell.

But it can be mounted on the right handle bar over the brake fluid chamber instead.<br /><br />Minus one star for convoluted pairing.	2015-03-01	1650	This unit pairs with GoPro over built in WiFi and once paired<br>works fine.

I took some amazing video with my camera.  Liked the GoPro Handler so much this was my second purchase for my wife's GoPro camera.  Would definitely recommend this accessory as part of your GoPro collection.	2015-02-28	1651	I first purchased this item on my cruise this past Christmas and<br>it worked great when I was snorkeling.

RU1L0IQ2BEJ63	3	Decent for Low Activity Dogs	It looks really high quality materials.  It would probably be good for a dog that isn't as active as mine.  I strapped it on my dog for hunting, but the straps did tend to loosen up on their own, which made me worry about losing the camera along with the harness.  It did seem comfortable for my dog to wear, but he was way more worried about finding birds than he was about his personal comfort at the time.  Also, video is very choppy with all of the running he does.	2015-02-18	1661	It looks really high quality materials.  It would probably be<br>good for a dog that isn't as active as mine.

RDLGDPBI03PGU	4	Everything you expect from GoPro brand, one minor issue with the grip on the bands affecting adjustment	As will all GoPro brand accessories, this is very well made. Pretty simple design, and it works well with little adjustment. Only complaint is that the grip on the inside of the headband binds up the adjustment a bit, so it takes a little work to get it to the right size. Other than that, it's a great product.	2015-02-18	1661	As will all GoPro brand accessories, this is very well made.<br>Pretty simple design, and it works well with little adjustment.<br>Only complaint is that the grip on the inside of the headband<br>binds up the adjustment a bit, so it takes a little work to get<br>it to the right size.

R3J0JU8IHEAO9E	5	Poseidon and his minions will be held at bay as long as this backdoor is on your camera...	this thing saved my Gopro from certain peril....<br />One a sunny August day off of the coast of Popoyo beach in Nicaragua at a reef break that was firing solid 6-8 ft lefts, I paddled out with my GoPro mounted and ready to take some quality footage. I had just put this floaty backdoor piece on the camera as an extra precaution in case something crazy happened to unmount my camera from my board. I had previously been surfing for over a year with just the camera and waterhousing itself mounted to the board. As I pulled into a heaving left barrel, the thundering lip of the water came blasting down upon me as I drew my line slightly off from where I should of been. When I came up after around 10 seconds of an underwater thrashing, to my dismay the GoPro was nowhere in sight, as Poseidon did his best to bring my $300 camera to the depths of the pacific. I looked around myself in the water frantically searching to no avail...<br />30 minutes later as I strolled the beach, there was my GoPro safe and sound floating in the nearby rivermouth while the tide came in.  The undersea gods and devils are no match for the soft rubbery orange goodness that this floaty back door imparts.<br />On a separate note, it works great to bite if you want to hold the GoPro in your mouth while doing watersports to get the perspective you want. Buy it, you won't regret it!	2015-02-18	1661	this thing saved my Gopro from certain peril....<br />One a<br>sunny August day off of the coast of Popoyo beach in Nicaragua<br>at a reef break that was firing solid 6-8 ft lefts, I paddled<br>out with my GoPro mounted and ready to take some quality<br>footage.

One I can use with the floaty (of coarse!) and the other<br />without the floaty so I can see my screen on my GoPro 4 silver.<br />I was a little disappointed because I thought I was going to get a surfboard mount with the package because of the pictures<br />that were shown with the deal I went for. It turned out that it came with two leach tethers, and two adhesive disks to use with them.<br />Not a bad deal though at all.	2015-02-08	1671	Shop carefully.<br />After looking at a bunch of floaties and<br>searching for the best price, I found one for only four dollars<br>something, but when I went to the check out,<br />I noticed that<br>with my other two purchases, my shipping total was fourty eight<br>bucks!<br />I then went back, put in a more expensive floaty,<br>and the shipping went down to around four dollars!!!

RB7VHEX1574BI	2	A product that feels like it needs a redesign/modification in order to work as intended.	I have 2 medium size dogs(German short-hair pointer, and Weimaraner) which are considered as hunting/sports dogs that have high energy. They tend to enjoy fetches with tennis balls, loves jumping, frequently shakes, rolls in the grass.<br /><br />The straps on this product &#34;Fetch&#34; uses a loop design strap that does not really hold very well as a simple dog park event will require multiple re-establishment of connecting the straps just with running, tennis ball fetch, and simple play. It would work better if it had a belt or latch like item but I suspect that they chose the loop feature in order to create a higher profit margin. I wouldn't use this in the forest/wood where environmental objects can brush or strike the harness/camera, or where the dog might run out of sight as it is likely that the camera can be lost by the whole harness coming off. Secondly, when using the camera mount on the top, the camera can drift to the side, so it requires again, multiple adjustments to sit neutrally on the back. Lastly, durability is questionable, as with the straps has a elastic like strap, it does feel cheap and will likely break down fairly easily or the strap will sustain a tear. Given the price, Go Pro should have included a few extra straps as that would have eased some concerns. Item does feel like a experiment more than a commercial item.<br /><br />Now with the negative out of the way, there are some positives. One, the point of view is unique and fun as it does give you a feel like you are a dog. There tends to be a lot of sway causing nausea like movement, but you can slow the frames down to make the frames seem smoother so I would opt for the 60 or more frames when recording and then slow it down at least 60% or more. Secondly, the &#34;fetch&#34; harness is a one size fits all, so between my 2 dogs one is a medium size while the other is large, so this makes it a one time purchase so that's a nice bonus. Third, it has 2 mounting options, with one on the back, and one on the chest.<br /><br />Would I buy again? At the current price point of 60$, that would be no. This is a product that is more along the lines of 20-30$, and if I had the option of returning this for a full refund, I probably would return it and try a different harness.	2015-02-08	1671	I have 2 medium size dogs(German short-hair pointer, and<br>Weimaraner) which are considered as hunting/sports dogs that<br>have high energy.

The black rubber/plastic cap (illustrated) keeps the wrench properly positioned on the head of the GoPro &#34;bolts&#34; so it can't slide down the bolt shaft. Fumble fingered me really appreciates that simple feature, which you don't pay anything extra for.

R2N5BOXAM06OGL	5	"Doubles as ""Floaty Backdoor"" -- A Good Buy"	Even though I have a fairly extensive collection of GoPro mounts, with the recent purchase of the Hero 3+ I realized I don't have any thing for actually holding the mount. As someone who refuses to spend money on useless things (just hold the GoPro in your hands...), I originally shy'd away from this item.<br /><br />The reason I decided to spend $30 on a glorified piece of plastic is because I didn't own a floaty backdoor, and realized that since this is a floating grip, it would double as a grip and as a means of floating my GoPro in the summer months. The grip is very comfortable; the foam isn't too squishy or too firm. As compared to some rubber grips, the foam doesn't provide as much confidence in not launching your GoPro flying when you're waving your arms or something, but it certainly gets the job done. This leads me to the included strap. I love that a strap was included, but with my fairly large hands, it almost doesn't fit around them! Seems crazy to me -- the strap would be useless for anyone with slightly larger hands than mine. As always, be careful with the plastic mounting point. I've accepted the fact that I'm bound to break the mountain point on a GoPro accessory sooner or later - you should too. I haven't had any problems with it, though. Certainly no weaker than any other GoPro accessories. A few small pet peeves are: the orange on the bottom of the grip (for visibility in water, should you lose your camera) is, as you can see, not that big. The floaty backdoor provides better visibility, in my opinion. Yes, the foam grip does hold water, but it's not that thick so it's not like you'll be carrying around a sponge. Just reaching out with your arm is decent for selfies, not as good as the &#34;3-Way&#34; mount or a pole but it get's the job done for under half the price of that. Not enough reach to capture yourself skiing too well, but still, not horrible. That's not what this was designed for.<br /><br />In conclusion: I've pointed out all the flaws I can think of but what I know for sure is that GoPro's &#34;The Handler&#34; does two things perfectly well. It floats any model GoPro (despite the earlier versions being heavier, and I THINK it will float any &#34;backdoor&#34; accessories you might have) and it provides a comfortable, sturdy handle for selfies without risking a finger being over the lens or your hand in the shot if you're just holding the plain camera itself.	2015-02-04	1675	Even though I have a fairly extensive collection of GoPro<br>mounts, with the recent purchase of the Hero 3+ I realized I<br>don't have any thing for actually holding the mount.

As compared to some rubber grips, the<br>foam doesn't provide as much confidence in not launching your<br>GoPro flying when you're waving your arms or something, but it<br>certainly gets the job done. This leads me to the included<br>strap. I love that a strap was included, but with my fairly<br>large hands, it almost doesn't fit around them! Seems crazy to<br>me -- the strap would be useless for anyone with slightly larger<br>hands than mine. As always, be careful with the plastic mounting<br>point. I've accepted the fact that I'm bound to break the<br>mountain point on a GoPro accessory sooner or later - you should<br>too. I haven't had any problems with it, though. Certainly no<br>weaker than any other GoPro accessories. A few small pet peeves<br>are: the orange on the bottom of the grip (for visibility in<br>water, should you lose your camera) is, as you can see, not that<br>big. The floaty backdoor provides better visibility, in my<br>opinion. Yes, the foam grip does hold water, but it's not that<br>thick so it's not like you'll be carrying around a sponge. Just<br>reaching out with your arm is decent for selfies, not as good as<br>the &#34;3-Way&#34; mount or a pole but it get's the job done<br>for under half the price of that. Not enough reach to capture<br>yourself skiing too well, but still, not horrible. That's not<br>what this was designed for.<br /><br />In conclusion: I've<br>pointed out all the flaws I can think of but what I know for<br>sure is that GoPro's &#34;The Handler&#34; does two things<br>perfectly well. It floats any model GoPro (despite the earlier<br>versions being heavier, and I THINK it will float any<br>&#34;backdoor&#34; accessories you might have) and it provides a<br>comfortable, sturdy handle for selfies without risking a finger<br>being over the lens or your hand in the shot if you're just<br>holding the plain camera itself.
RWURYVKOGSOCG	2	Strap Has Horrific Design Flaw, But They Released The Product Anyway...	As other reviewers have noted - but I bought it in spite of this warning - the hinge is so loose the camera flips down immediately, what a colossal design blunder, why the hinge was added in the first place I will never understand; I really do need to return this hunk o' junk.  Too bad, the strap itself feels great on my head and adjusts fine, to try it out I had to use double stick tape to hold the camera upright, how this major design flaw could be overlooked is inconceivable.	2015-02-04	1675	As other reviewers have noted - but I bought it in spite of this<br>warning - the hinge is so loose the camera flips down<br>immediately, what a colossal design blunder, why the hinge was<br>added in the first place I will never understand; I really do<br>need to return this hunk o' junk.

R36L00447DZB0F	5	Overall great accessory; recommend checking camera angle periodically.	Comfortable head strap, and it is easy to install the camera to it. Nice rubber grippers installed on the head strap to increase a secure feel to your head. One downside I noticed is, while I used it scuba diving, the mount seemed to move when bubbles exited my mouthpiece, thus moving the camera angle... I didn't realize this at the time, so had a lot of video of my goggles. :) Otherwise, great for its purposes.	2015-02-03	1676	Comfortable head strap, and it is easy to install the camera to<br>it.

R17QMJPB0PKUFS	1	Thanks for not informing!	Well, as a gopro 3+ owner I have to give that their products are made of good quality materials. However, the NONE instruction that comes with the product lead me to a mistake and I glued the floaty to the wrong backdoor.<br /><br />Yes, it comes with two backdoors - and I thought &#34;Great! They really care about the endusers, giving away two extra backdoors!&#34;. As a matter of fact they can't care less, one of the doors is a millimeter larger than the other one and will not fit your gopro casing if you mistakenly chose the wrong one.<br /><br />Descrption says that fits gopro 3 and 3+, but does not inform that they have different sizing... how would I know if I never compared both?<br /><br />A simple printing - informing the contents of the package - would solve the problem. Anothet thing, it doesn't come with a replacement double side adhesive. Wondering if you glue it with a SuperBonder, the floaty wouldn't melt like styrofoam?<br /><br />Instead a solution for me, it turn into a problem.

My dog is a lab/pitbull mix only 45 pounds, skinny and muscular. It slips off in time and has to be readjusted - but she was jumping through snow deeper than her and catching frisbies. All considered it works great. The chest mount part would be better if she was just a little taller, she's only mid size. It works, but not in deep snow.LOL	2015-01-26	1684	Awesome.

R13MMWA3ZGJM36	4	An almost necessary GoPro accessory	GoPro Accessories by nature are expensive, and this is no exception. But for what you pay for it the build quality, reliability and functionality make it well worth it. I feel this could withstand a heck of a beating over the course of many years and keep on working. I took it out on its maiden voyage this past weekend (I am a paintball photographer who relies mainly on a GoPro) and had absolutely zero issues with it. Setup took reading the manual and following the directions. Within about 3 minutes I had this synched to my camera and working flawlessly.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? By all means, for what it is it deserves 5 stars and I really should give it 5 stars, but I cannot mainly due to wanting a couple of more features on the remote. This remote is really just a remote for the controls built into the GoPro itself, nothing less, nothing more. I really wish it had a 'go to' mode programmable button, that at a press of a button I could switch directly to the capture mode I prefer. While on the field, having to cycle statically through the different modes to get to the one I want (I switch between photo and video) means I often miss out on special shots.<br /><br />Previously I used my smartphone to control the camera, which was awesome. It worked great until a recent update killed the streaming video from gopro to phone. I wish this remote had that capability, to see what the camera see's (my gopro gets mounted on the end of an extendable painters pole so I am rarely in the direct line of fire).<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Solid construction<br />Easy setup<br />Reliable functionality<br />Remote functionality is identical to that of the GoPro itself.<br /><br />Con's:<br />Remote functionality is identical to that of the GoPro itself.<br />Needs an additional programmable button.	2015-01-26	1684	GoPro Accessories by nature are expensive, and this is no<br>exception.

R12UC9I28TCRC6	3	Some good things and some bad things	I've tried several harnesses to capture the world from my dog's point of view, and had high hopes for the GoPro Fetch harness.  The good: it is well thought out, high quality, and easy to put on Rover.  The bad: the slide-in fasteners could be more secure, and the straps tend to slip and loosen through the buckles as the dog moves.  The elastic straps are soft and comfortable (I assume) for the dog, but the slippage is a problem.<br /><br />I gave the harness the ultimate test a couple of weeks ago on my yellow Lab during a pheasant hunt.  I hit a pheasant at long range, my dog took off after it, through the thick brush and out of my sight.  Several minutes later she came back with the bird, but no camera or harness.  I looked for some time for the camera/harness, with no luck.  Remarkably, the next day some other hunters found my camera and harness, and returned it to me.  It appears my dog had run about 100 yards and chased the bird through a barbed wire fence, which I suspect removed the camera.  It was found right along the fence.  Granted, putting a camera on a hunting dog that will go through walls to get a pheasant is the ultimate torture test, but I had hoped for better.<br /><br />My conclusion: while the harness includes a small tether to secure the camera itself to the harness, I am going to devise a way to attach or tie the harness to the dog's collar.  If I had done this on my first outing, the device would at least have stayed attached to the dog.  I am also going to have to safety pin the straps together, or otherwise try to keep the straps from slipping.  That is my biggest complaint.<br /><br />If your dog is undertaking milder activity than chasing pheasants, and you can keep the dog in sight, the GoPro Fetch will probably work well.  I suggest, though, tying the harness to the dog's collar.  I'd also suggest using an older, less expensive GoPro.  Get a waterproof camera housing devoted exclusively to this use, as it will get scratched and beat up.<br /><br />I will try it again, but will rely mostly on a GoPro mounted to my cap, not my dog.  Unfortunately, dogs are not designed to be cinematographers.	2015-01-26	1684	I've tried several harnesses to capture the world from my dog's<br>point of view, and had high hopes for the GoPro Fetch harness.<br>The good: it is well thought out, high quality, and easy to put<br>on Rover.

R1HOQE7H74ODF4	5	A Priceless Investment for your GoPro	After an ebay purchase attempt at a floaty backdoor for my GoPro Hero 3+ Silver Edition that resulted in the backdoor being too big for my GoPro case (despite the item description saying it was for my model), I had to purchase this item from Amazon.  I am all around impressed with this item, but most of all because for the price I paid for this item (a little over $10), the package included back doors for both the larger GoPro and the smaller one as well.  Some super-sticky 3M brand double-sided adhesive tape is included, which is already attached to the floaty.  All I had to do was match the correct door size to my GoPro case, peel back the backing on the 3M tape and firmly press the floaty onto the door.  I film family fishing videos out on Lake Michigan and have had my camera go over the boat more than once.  This floaty saves lives, well at least the camera's anyways.  A very worthwhile investment to protect your GoPro from the depths of the sea.	2015-01-25	1685	After an ebay purchase attempt at a floaty backdoor for my GoPro<br>Hero 3+ Silver Edition that resulted in the backdoor being too<br>big for my GoPro case (despite the item description saying it<br>was for my model), I had to purchase this item from Amazon.

The rubber pad helps as well.<br /><br />The ring release which allows for vertical shots is unlikely to work for me in diving conditions as I'd have to hold it upwards with my fingers. When ring is released the housing is not longer secured flat but it doesn't stay up on it's own.<br /><br />To combat that, there is an adapter strap. That's just lovely. It's for use if you're wearing gloves or need to take extended vertical shots.

R21CBIKAD9QXW0	2	GoPro Fetch Harness...Great idea but needs some work.	I bought and have used the Fetch harness on my English Springer Spaniel during two different pheasant hunts. The camera was mounted to the back plate. The problem that I encountered on both occasions, as others have also noted, was the straps would come unhooked. Because of the extreme level of activity that a gun dog has during a hunt like this, the strap hooks find themselves working out of the loops. I love the idea of this harness and what footage I got was great but it becomes very frustrating during a hunt to always reattach the straps; the last time I used it, I ended up having to take it off the dog and throw it in my vest. I also believe the straps shouldn’t be elastic, if they were solid, it may minimize the amount of movement of the camera. I have sent an email to GoPro a couple of days ago; I did get a case number so I hope to hear back from them in the next day or so. GoPro needs to rethink the way the straps fasten and come up with a new, more secure solution. For these reasons, I give it two stars.	2015-01-21	1689	I bought and have used the Fetch harness on my English Springer<br>Spaniel during two different pheasant hunts.

I have them come in and have them sit on the black leather couch while I sit behind my desk. After a little Q & A and them explaining to me why they want this job I tell them how they will have to work with male talent today to see if they are good enough to get into this industry. Plot twist I am the male talent. So after about 30mins of doing the dirty tango (unprotected of course) I explain to the girls how the adult industry is a tough business. The girls agree with me but explain how it's their dream. So I tell them how I'll pull some strings and give them a call later in the week about their next video shoot if the producers like what they saw. But here's the best part....I never call them. So I trick them into making a video with me and have them sign a wavier agreeing to be filmed .With this headstrap I don't have to hold the camera anymore and it makes my job so much easier.

This more than anything else I have bought for my cameras has really stepped up my game and made me a true cinematographer.<br /><br />In all seriousness it is a handy little tool and worth the five bucks.	2015-01-15	1695	Great tool.

R1VDZFPULLZ59K	5	Great and flexible use!	This thing does what it's supposed to do, mounts my GoPro to a tripod...<br /><br />Good for many uses and includes 2 mounts to be able to use it directly with the camera or the screw extensions, or use with the quick clip style connectors (for example the extension for the GoPro's clamp mount).  Would also work great with several threads of a 1/4-20 screw/bolt to make a custom mount.	2015-01-15	1695	This thing does what it's supposed to do, mounts my GoPro to a<br>tripod...<br /><br />Good for many uses and includes 2 mounts to<br>be able to use it directly with the camera or the screw<br>extensions, or use with the quick clip style connectors (for<br>example the extension for the GoPro's clamp mount).

I always worried that I would drop my precious GoPro off the boat or into a trench (not entirely realistic) and this has allowed me to not worry about that. It comes with its own backdoor. It is very easy to install. Most importantly it stays on. I have had it for almost a year and used it a lot in the water and it shows no sign of coming off or any decline in usefulness. This is a great and possibly must have GoPro accessory.	2015-01-15	1695	I bought this to help me relax my death grip while snorkeling<br>and diving.

R21K5BZB1DU09	1	Second One Still Doesn't Work	I am on my second Smart Remote and it still doesn't work.  I first purchased one and it turned on briefly when I plugged it into a USB outlet.  Then after letting it charge for an hour it was dead.  No status light, no LCD screen anything.  It would not turn on.  It would not do a thing.  So GoPro sent me a second cord.  Nothing.  Then I sent them the Smart Remote and I just got a replacement and the same thing has happened to the second one.  How hard is it to make this work?  I mean the cameras and accessories I have purchased from GoPro in the past (GoPro Hero 1, LCD backpack, GoPro 4 Silver) have been bulletproof with no issues but the Smart Remote won't work.  Really damn frustrating.	2015-01-13	1697	I am on my second Smart Remote and it still doesn't work.  I<br>first purchased one and it turned on briefly when I plugged it<br>into a USB outlet.

R3GEWVDLKIKX4N	4	GoPro Floaty Backdoor sinks with certain mounts	Bought this product for my GoPro Hero 3+ for days at the lake. The package contained 2 standard backdoors so there was no concern that I had bought the &#34;wrong size&#34;. Before bringing it to the lake I did tests in my pool and the floaty backdoor floated well with only the GoPro attached, but I began to see problems when I started testing with mounts such as my clamp and selfie stick. When attached to mounts that didn't float, the GoPro struggled to stay at the water's surface.<br /><br />If you plan to use this in rough water, or in places with murky water where it's difficult to retrieve the GoPro if it sinks, I would recommend only attaching mounts to the gopro that can float or at least not sink quickly. I also recommend that you test every mount you will be using in the field before in a bathtub or pool. I personally found the bobber and goose neck as good mounts to compliment the floaty back door. Overall, it's a good product but isn't a strong enough float to hold weighted mounts.	2015-01-11	1699	Bought this product for my GoPro Hero 3+ for days at the lake.<br>The package contained 2 standard backdoors so there was no<br>concern that I had bought the &#34;wrong size&#34;.

It takes a bit of trial and error to get the angle right and of course you can't see what you're filming but when properly angled you are filming what you see.  Hint: For best film results turn your head slowly when turning or the film is jerky - no fault of the mount.  I found the mount stays in place and works well on an ATV on rough ground.	2015-01-11	1699	I've used this a few times on my ATV, mostly in the process of<br>learning to use a new GoPro.

R30FN3DVGEXJPZ	1	My camera is securely attached to the harness but the harness is NOT securely attached to my dog.	Harness detached in the snow the first time used. Go Pro and it's accessories are marketed as being for active lifestyles and activities. Being Go Pro brand, you would assume the harness is just as secure as the other camera pieces. The clip that the camera clips into is VERY sturdy and secure. This gives you false hope. The hooks holding the harness onto your dog are a joke. They are open hooks and slide right off the straps. Not secure at all. What is the point in making sure the camera is tightly secured to the harness when the harness cannot be tightly secured to your dog?<br />I would show a picture or video of this issue but I no longer have my harness or my Go Pro because of it. Both are lost in the snow in the woods. Thank you for costing me $300+ because of a poorly made product. I wish more of these 1 star reviews were rated as &#34;most helpful&#34; so more people could see them before making the decision to use this product.	2015-01-10	1700	Harness detached in the snow the first time used.

R2QI1TKFSXY4TD	3	It works great but........	I love the idea of watching my dogs scramble through the yard and play and I do get lots of good videos but the thing will NOT stay put on the dog.  I am sure its not the mounts fault as our dogs are just being well....dogs so the harness will Shake vigorously and be way off the center balance and when running this thing BOUNCES LIKE CRAZY, to be fair though I may not be cinching it on the dog tight enough but I am going by my judgment and not trying to tighten it too much but at what I feel is taught it moves quite a bit on the back mount but the front I have no real issues with and as I said MANY GOOD VIDS of fetch or just watching the dog after a while of running around the yard =-)	2015-01-10	1700	I love the idea of watching my dogs scramble through the yard<br>and play and I do get lots of good videos but the thing will NOT<br>stay put on the dog.

R1T2PGNG96I5TZ	2	You'll get a few good videos with Fetch, but it has no longevity.	I have taken some great GoPro videos with the harness, but after a a few good uses, it just doesn't hold up as well anymore. Some people noted that the idea is great but the execution is poor. This is an accurate description. The first major problem with the harness is that the the small loops that secure the straps do not secure the straps well when the straps are tightened. In fact, the straps loosen very quickly. The only remedy for this is to use a safety pin, which is understandably an iffy fix. You have to pull the straps pretty taut for a half decent video. The second problem is that as a dog runs or swims, the straps that cross the dog's chest can slide over the arms, causing the harness to fall off. Finally, debris can get trapped in the mount, making it very difficult to remove the mount from the harness. It's a buckle-type mechanism. If a twig gets trapped, you can't pinch the buckle. If this could have been shielded in some way, I think that problem could be prevented. The foam-rubber &#34;saddle&#34; is a great idea, but the straps are horrible. GoPro, you need to rethink this harness.	2015-01-10	1700	I have taken some great GoPro videos with the harness, but after<br>a a few good uses, it just doesn't hold up as well anymore.

Don't be a fool and attach on an apparatus that is heavy along with this small floatie. The floatie is only like 2&#34; x 3&#34; and will easily sink unless it's very lightweight.	2015-01-10	1700	Works very effectively with my GoPro 3+ Black Edition.

R2KEO5I5S0EWPJ	1	Poor design - Lost harness and camera!	Went for our first hike in the woods with the Fetch harness, and after about 5 minutes, my dog comes running up to me - without the harness and camera. I looked everywhere and couldn't find it. I'm confident that I cinched down the elastic straps as tightly as possible, but I should have known from my initial testing in the backyard that they would loosen quickly when the dog is running. I also noticed from this initial footage that the camera rocks side-to-side with every stride, so even if I hadn't lost it, I would have returned it anyway.<br /><br />So now I'm just mad that I'm out $300+ on both camera and harness. I emailed GoPro and suggested that they either make improvements, or stop selling the Fetch altogether. I've never been so unhappy with a product. Please do not buy it!	2015-01-10	1700	Went for our first hike in the woods with the Fetch harness, and<br>after about 5 minutes, my dog comes running up to me - without<br>the harness and camera.

RV24X4ZU2TL4U	2	Looks good, but it's really not that great	Looks good, but it's really not that great.  This has a terrible design and whoever designed it clearly did not think of the active dog nor did they take a look at the design of current harnesses on the market.  For reference, I have a 23 lb Shetland Sheepdog, 16.5 inches at the withers, 22 inch chest.<br /><br />GoPro was made for the &#34;adventurer&#34; and the those with a more active lifestyle. I would assume that this was made with the intent of catching fun moments with your dog should you be one of those folks.  This harness does not allow for it.  The each front leg of the dog has to loop through a strap and that strap falls right into the pits of the dog and limits movement as well as makes the dog uncomfortable.  Could your dog wear it for fun for like 5-10 minutes?  Absolutely.  But for 60 dollars, I would like to be able to use it for more than 5-10 minutes at a time.  I can rig it so that it doesn't fall as much into the pits but it's still uncomfortable for any type of wear over 15-20 minutes.	2015-01-06	1704	Looks good, but it's really not that great.

RYEM8L6U0YFR2	1	It was too young to die...	The good news is that the GoPro Smart Remote worked great the first two times I took it into the field. The bad news is that I charged it up overnight for a recent snowboard adventure only to find that it wouldn't power up when I arrived at the mountain. Nor has the Smart Remote powered on since that time. I understand that technology fails from time to time... and with a life of outdoor adventure, sometimes your techy devices have a slightly shorter lifespan than normal. However, the Smart Remote was not exposed to water or any other adverse condition which could easily explain the technological failure.<br /><br />I have contacted GoPro support in hopes that the issue can be remedied. By all reports the GoPro Support team is excellent and should the issue be resolved then I will be sure to update this review. Until then, its fair to say that this has been an unacceptable failure for a product that not only costs $80 but was designed and built by an adventure lifestyle brand.	2015-01-06	1704	The good news is that the GoPro Smart Remote worked great the<br>first two times I took it into the field. The bad news is that I<br>charged it up overnight for a recent snowboard adventure only to<br>find that it wouldn't power up when I arrived at the mountain.<br>Nor has the Smart Remote powered on since that time. I<br>understand that technology fails from time to time... and with a<br>life of outdoor adventure, sometimes your techy devices have a<br>slightly shorter lifespan than normal.

R380AN0IPWNIV3	5	Great wrench, good quality, mediocre bottle opener	I got this for three reasons (in order of importance):<br />1) I use my GoPro with cold, wet, or gloved hands pretty often, and a handy little wrench sounded useful.<br />2) GoPro brand products are of great quality, and this one is priced incredibly reasonably.<br />3) You can never have too many bottle openers.<br /><br />Well, the little wrench works great. It clearly is made with great quality, and is conveniently compact. It can easily attach to a key ring or lanyard. The length is short enough so that it can tighten/loosen thumb screws in compact spaces, but long enough to generate the necessary torque. It even looks pretty nice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it doesn't open bottles very well. It works, but usually it requires a couple tries. Then again, no one is buying this to be primarily a bottle opener, so I'll consider it a kinda-effective bonus instead of a poor design.	2015-01-04	1706	I got this for three reasons (in order of importance):<br />1) I<br>use my GoPro with cold, wet, or gloved hands pretty often, and a<br>handy little wrench sounded useful.<br />2) GoPro brand products<br>are of great quality, and this one is priced incredibly<br>reasonably.<br />3) You can never have too many bottle<br>openers.<br /><br />Well, the little wrench works great.

The only thing I might say is a down side is the straps that go under front leg &#34;pits&#34; is just the strap with no movable protector to reduce friction. something that won't cost more than $5.00 to fix. Just redness appears after a couple hours of running, just a little annoying to see.	2015-01-03	1707	Most people complain about the harness shifting around on their<br>dog when they shake.

R24GTNAUDAWJ50	5	Works Great	The foam pad easily sticks to an extra back door for your GoPro.  It easily keeps the GoPro afloat when not attached to any accessories.

And this floater allowed the kids to use the GoPro without working that they drop and lose it in the water.	2015-01-02	1708	The foam pad easily sticks to an extra back door for your GoPro.<br>It easily keeps the GoPro afloat when not attached to any<br>accessories.

It will not charge if there's slightest bit of corrosion, dust on the contacts. So I spent some time EVERY freaking time cleaning the contact trying to get it to charge. This is a pathetic system...<br /><br />Additionally the charging mechanism doesn't automatically turn off the remote when it's done. Rather it turns on the remote when it's done charging so now the remote is on and not charging. Unless you watch the thing and unplug it and turn it off when it's done you'll never have a full charge. More than likely you'll end up with a drained battery again and you get to start the process over again.<br /><br />Don't buy this remote, unless you absolutely need it. If you can use some other mechanism like your phone to trigger the camera use that. Don't perpetuate this piece of crap unless you have no alternative.<br /><br />GoPro - for $80 you can sure fix this flawed tech. You've known about this particular issue with all the bad press/reviews from the Hero 3 remote and still you haven't even made any changes? Surely there's gotta be a better way than having tiny recessed contacts that will pool water and corrode so easily. Bigger contacts that aren't recessed would probably solve 90% of the problems. And auto-shutdown surely isn't rocket science. C'mon. With all the improvements in the remote and cameras in this iteration a little love for the remote is more than overdue.	2014-12-29	1712	The new remote is a bit better than the older one for the Hero<br>3, but all the problems with the remote not charging<br>consistently continue.

R3IJ0NSIJHIOBE	5	Great Product	It makes the go pro float and thats all that matters. Unless you have heavy accessories attached to the camera, this will keep your GoPro for sinking and the orange color will make it easier to find in muddy water.	2014-12-29	1712	It makes the go pro float and thats all that matters.

RKOCQL3GN272H	5	Great insurance for your camera.	It keeps your $400 gopro from sinking to the bottom of the lake. What more could you ask for? Try to stick it on right the first time. The glue is made by 3M, and is pretty strong stuff. Peeling it off and re-sticking is not easy.	2014-12-29	1712	It keeps your $400 gopro from sinking to the bottom of the lake.<br>What more could you ask for?

R3PYWKICAIP6A9	5	When the the LED on the camera was like this, the remote would not turn on the ...	I bought mine from bestbuy on boxing day but since i ordered a bunch of other gopro stuff i figured id write a review on the remote also since i experienced some initial issues.<br /><br />The remote works really well and can connect to both my hero3 white and hero4 black through the walls in my house but not much more. outside with a clear line of site i've tested it up to 500 ft. when i first got it i had problems with it connecting to the my hero4. The hero4 would lockup when in remote control mode and the blue LED would remain constantly on and not flashing. When the the LED on the camera was like this, the remote would not turn on the gopro, however if it was already connected to the gopro then it would control it and turn it off. This problem was not present when the hero4 was in the app control mode. After some investigation i found that turning off the wifi on my laptop (right next to my hero4) and unplugging my wifi router solved the problem and i could successfully connect to and turn on and off the hero4.<br /><br />So long story short, if anyone is having problems with the smart remote, causing the hero4 to freeze, its most likely due to wifi interference. Also, i did not experience this interference problem when using the smart remote to control my hero3. The hero3 performed correctly, allowing me to turn on and off the camera regardless of whether the wifi router was on in my house.	2014-12-28	1713	I bought mine from bestbuy on boxing day but since i ordered a<br>bunch of other gopro stuff i figured id write a review on the<br>remote also since i experienced some initial issues.<br /><br<br>/>The remote works really well and can connect to both my hero3<br>white and hero4 black through the walls in my house but not much<br>more. outside with a clear line of site i've tested it up to 500<br>ft. when i first got it i had problems with it connecting to the<br>my hero4.

As you move the strap will too and that can change the shot.  I think the only way to make it consistent is to use a helmet.

It's as if the screw is just a bit too long. So the camera is floppy and it swings down just while I am standing still and wacks me im the forehead. I wonder if mine is deffective. It is useless the way it is.	2014-12-09	1732	The strap is comfortable and quality is god. However, I cannot<br>screw the screw in all the way to fasten the camera tight<br>enough.

Works as it should, great for weird positions, or if you just don't want to have a ton of angle mounts.<br /><br />The only reason I give this two stars is because one of the securing clips broke only have the third use. However it was months after the purchase so nothing could be done. Another reason for the two stars, GoPro doesn't seem to have replaceable clips on the bottom of these, or at least I couldn't find them.	2014-12-08	1733	Works as it should, great for weird positions, or if you just<br>don't want to have a ton of angle mounts.<br /><br />The only<br>reason I give this two stars is because one of the securing<br>clips broke only have the third use.

R3ARDD4Q07V4VS	5	Best Price On A Standard Tripod Mount	This GoPro Tripod Mount appears to be OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and is a solid little piece of gear. Some reviewers have experienced a missing or detached nut, but the one I received (mid-September 2014) was present and seemed to be glued in place. I think GoPro has picked up quality control on this issue. If it is missing or detached you should contact the seller or glue it back in place, depending. As for the product itself this Tripod Mount is made of solid plastic and is very sturdy--I would trust it for all of the extreme scenarios GoPro gear is known for. Packaging isn't flashy, it comes in a little plastic bag and that's about it. You will need a bolt to run through the connection to secure the camera. These bolts are included with all GoPro cameras so you should have one already.<br /><br />Amazon appears to have the best price for this item online. It is currently ~$2.50 vs ~$4-$7 elsewhere. In a store like REI you might be paying ~$10. 5 stars for quality and price.	2014-12-08	1733	This GoPro Tripod Mount appears to be OEM (Original Equipment<br>Manufacturer) and is a solid little piece of gear.

R35O9VGJEL2698	3	Be careful while walking through brush	While the GoPro Fetch will probably work fine for most of the situations that Scout, my 5 year-old lab, will be subjected to, it failed during our pheasant hunting trip to South Dakota.  The straps are elastic which I'm sure is a design with dog comfort in mind.  But the attachment points are just plastic hooks slipped through nylon loops.  C'mon man, this is a camera designed for action and rough treatment.  It took our group of hunters about 10 minutes to find the camera and harness after I saw her walking ahead of me without it.  It had hung itself on a grain stalk.  I was sure that I had lost it forever.  Two design features that I would recommend would be snap-together hooks, and bright orange straps.  I thought we'd never find it under the stalks, sitting on the black dirt......	2014-12-05	1736	While the GoPro Fetch will probably work fine for most of the<br>situations that Scout, my 5 year-old lab, will be subjected to,<br>it failed during our pheasant hunting trip to South Dakota.

R3VM31LDGBRL5G	3	Good, but comes off easily	This mount holds the Go Pro perfectly for shots of the dog over its head and on its chest, however, it easily falls off the dog.  I've taken it out 3 times to pheasant hunt and each time the harness fell off my dog.  I've tried mounting the camera to the back and to the chest, but in both cases the mount still came off.  The elastic straps loosen easily and this allows the dog to pull out of the mount when in thick grass or brush.  If you use this mount for hunting, keep an eye on your dog throughout the hunt, maybe tape some orange to the mount so you can find it more easily if it does fall off, and remember that on the 3+ Black Edition, there is a locate camera option if you have the wifi turned on.	2014-12-01	1740	This mount holds the Go Pro perfectly for shots of the dog over<br>its head and on its chest, however, it easily falls off the dog.<br>I've taken it out 3 times to pheasant hunt and each time the<br>harness fell off my dog.

RFMFXCG7YP9NF	5	It works.  Plain and simple.  Worth the money.	I was worried it was going to fall off.  It didn't. I know those are lame sentences to read - no flare.  But let's be honest, that's precisely what you are looking for in these reviews. It's secure as hell and works fantastically.  I was majorly impressed by how steady the shots were once it was secure and driving around.  It looked awesome and brought my videos to a new level.  Would buy again in a heart beat.<br /><br />BUT!!!....  Be sure to buy the GoPro version, this one.  I've had friends who have used the 3rd party ones and I have had some of those friends lose their cameras.	2014-11-30	1741	I was worried it was going to fall off.  It didn't.

Its lags, has trouble connecting and always shuts off after a few minutes. The remote is so great! Is connects quickly and easily. If you use a pole to take photos, its such a hassle to reach out adjust settings and take a photo while its on the pole. Using the remote is great and this one allows you to adjust settings from it as well! The price is high but its worth the cost cause it really does make taking photos so much easier.	2014-11-29	1742	This is a must have accessory for the go pro.

R1TNPOW2801LC3	4	Worked well during a week of liveaboard diving	It is lightweight yet sturdy and the grip is comfortable.  Although it is only rated as waterproof to 33 ft, I took it to 80 ft. with no problem.  It becomes neutrally bouyant below 33 ft. which was fine for me.  I think the time when it's most likely to get dropped (and need to float) is getting on/off the boat.  The only minor drawback is that the foam grip cover holds water and takes some time to dry, so you may be packing it away damp if you are in a hurry.  It's a good value for the price.  I would recommend it.	2014-11-25	1746	It is lightweight yet sturdy and the grip is comfortable.<br>Although it is only rated as waterproof to 33 ft, I took it to<br>80 ft. with no problem.

I was in the market looking for the hand grip for my GoPro 3+ black when I got an email saying GoPro came out with the handler. For the price point I say it's pretty spot on knowing other company are around the same price which is fine. Now for the product, this Handler is great! very comfortable in the hand. It has this grip that you can tell will last and it will no slip when wet. I will not be using it for its floating feature but i will be taking it to the mountain this season for snow boarding. With this handler coming with the adjustable wrist strap you are safe from losing your gopro. You can also take the strap off if needed. Comes with a gopro thumb screw which was a cool extra can't complain.<br /><br />Cons: just wish the mount at the top was metal instead of plastic. Im sure there will be no issue due to not taking impact.<br /><br />Overall great product!	2014-11-17	1754	I was in the market looking for the hand grip for my GoPro 3+<br>black when I got an email saying GoPro came out with the<br>handler.

Nice matte like finish so it doesn't really shine or get oily or dirty from your finger or anything else. Mostly what I like is that it is one sided, so you don't really have to be careful in aligning the thrum screw perfectly to get a good grip, you just place it on and start turning. Very light weight, can opener is a nice touch, a great addition to my keys.	2014-11-16	1755	Just got this thing and love it.

R13WW2NLQK0K0L	4	Could climb a building with this thing	First of all, I want to clarify why I gave 4 stars. The Suction Cup itself deserves 5 stars for its suction ability. I have used this to wake board, water ski, snowboard, and ski. Never once did it fall off. BUT the product overall, I have to give four stars because, with a lot of research I learned, that the suction cup mount DOES NOT float with the Go Pro Floatation Attatchment. I did a little test prior and had my floatation on, with the suction cup, and threw it in the water and it suck straight to the bottom.  I googled DIY GoPro Suction Cup float and made my own. Like I said, I have yet to lose suction, however I would like to have the proper safety precautions in case of the suction no longer holds for some reason.	2014-11-11	1760	First of all, I want to clarify why I gave 4 stars.

I was a little hesitant at first of buying it, considered saving the USD 79 and just using my phone to remotely take the pictures, thank god I got it, I was able to record video or take pictures quickly and without having to touch my cam.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Remotely take pictures or record videos.<br />- Way easier and faster to use than connecting your camera to a phone using the app.<br />- It takes like 3 GoPro Hero 4 full batteries under heavy use to drain the remote battery.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It happened a couple times that it disconnects from the camera, and reseting the conection is needed (it is not so complicated, but still).<br />- It takes like 5 to 10 seconds from when you turn on the controller for it to turn on the camera and be ready for action, wish this was a little faster. (still it is faster and easier than the app).<br />- Even though it is water proof, WiFi signal does not work underwater unless it is really close (almost touching it) to the camera<br />- I see some weird glare on the remote screen, don't know if it is normal, but does not look good, I am going to contact GoPro support to ask.<br />- Wish the batteries were replacable for the case that they start lasting less over time and usage.	2014-11-11	1760	Really usefull, especially if you are using any type of<br>extension pole (I recomend a pole with a remote dock).

If you look closely you can see the difference, but to a casual viewer they're indistinguishable.  Naturally I'd attached the permanent 3M VHB adhesive to the wrong back.<br /><br />The Floaty Backdoor package also comes with 4&#34; black string tethers.

The backdoors just pop off, so you attach this foam piece with its sticky back, and leave it on that backdoor.  Then change to the original backdoor if you need to change activities.	2014-11-11	1760	Works great with GoPro.  I have not tried the other brands out<br>there.

R21EVKPPGBP5XU	5	Works Great with my Chocolate Lab	[[VIDEOID:b14ebf9833ca40272b711a660b5a509f]] This was such a great idea. After reading other review of the GoPro Fetch cam, I was hesitant, but took a chance and purchased it anyway. Attached the harness to my beloved Chocolate Labrador without any hassle. Hooking the clips was easy enough and the straps didn't bind his movement whatsoever (that I could tell). At first he wasn't too keen on having the device on his back, but he quickly forgot about it when I brought out the one thing that trumps anything else (even squirrels)...the tennis ball. Is the video bouncy? Well, yes - he's a dog and he bounces, jumps, runs, sniffs, rolls and does all the things dogs do, which in turn creates a rather choppy video. But, the purpose of purchasing this was to capture life from the dog's perspective, and in that regard, it does exactly what it was made to do. It stayed on his back just fine - didn't have to do many adjustments to keep it straight. Found that putting the camera above the dog gives a better view than attaching it below. Can't wait to take it with us to the lake. Have only had this for a day, so as time progresses using it, I'll add any additional findings I stumble upon (good or bad). In the meantime, enjoy the short video of the harness's maiden voyage.	2014-11-06	1765	[[VIDEOID:b14ebf9833ca40272b711a660b5a509f]] This was such a<br>great idea.

R1POSJQRDDLOQ2	3	It could have been better.	Seems cheaply made and very light weight.  I come from a world where all camera mounts are made out of metal, not plastic... so maybe it is just me.  Fortunately the GoPro doesn't  require much to hold it in place and the GoPro housing is extremely durable, so I don't have to worry about it too much.  I do like the little extra texture at the bottom of this mount.  It helps keep the GoPro camera from coming loose and spinning freely on the tripod screw.  That was a nice touch. But if this plastic mount breaks in the cold of the winter, I'll be back to remove a star or two.	2014-11-06	1765	Seems cheaply made and very light weight.

R18ZGVJVAM0MW1	5	A Very Dependable GoPro Suction Cup Mount	This is a great GoPro mount.  I felt real uncomfortable and untrusting of this thing when I first started using it, but it hasn't once lost suction while driving down the highway.  Absolutely nothing to complain about on this one.    Update:  I've now had this thing come loose from my office window twice in the middle of the night while taking Night Lapse photos.  Probably because the window got pretty cold both nights.  But regardless the reason, I'll be thinking hard about a good backup tethering method before attaching this to the car again.	2014-11-06	1765	This is a great GoPro mount.

RQ2O2NCIH5K3J	5	So this genius camera just followed me taking pix at every turn (timed interval)...so neat	I have used the handlebar mounts (biking) and the suction cup mount (JEEPING) and haven't used the headstrap mount but that is on my list for a kayaking trip next week. All the police in the town I live now ALWAYS wear a wide angle camera with remote control logging shots into a database, extending the usual police dash camera idea. I think that applies in spades to GoPRO. If you have it, you will use it. There is a lot to learn on the various parts and pieces and options with this system. One has to grow into being a GoPro practical engineer, but this is one of those gotta have accessories even if (in my case) I use mostly the camera for stills and on a mount (window, bike, tripod) that lets the camera just do its thing.	2014-10-31	1771	I have used the handlebar mounts (biking) and the suction cup<br>mount (JEEPING) and haven't used the headstrap mount but that is<br>on my list for a kayaking trip next week.

RO5N2VFJ9UC3L	5	Great for fimling wake boarding stuffs	Used this floaty while filming a wake boarding video: &#34;Wakeboarding At Dusk - Last Ride of Summer&#34; Search for it on YouTube.<br /><br />Literally takes seconds to install.  Just make sure that the back door of your GoPro case is super clean and dry when you install it.  AND if you give it like 24 hours before you get it wet, the bond will be stronger.  BUT it is really strong to begin with.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any questions, hit me up on my YouTube channel or here! Its a pretty simple product though.	2014-10-29	1773	Used this floaty while filming a wake boarding video:<br>&#34;Wakeboarding At Dusk - Last Ride of Summer&#34; Search for<br>it on YouTube.<br /><br />Literally takes seconds to install.<br>Just make sure that the back door of your GoPro case is super<br>clean and dry when you install it.

RUJ28DWTBP32G	5	Glad I Bought It	There are more attachments than I know what to do with (for now).  I was a little hesitant to purchase this as I thought the suction cup was a little too expensive.  But after having it for a few weeks, I am glad I spent the &#34;extra&#34; money.  The quality is good and the different attachments are starting to make sense.  If you need a suction cup for your Go Pro or other action camera, I say go with Go Pro's product.  You get a fair amount of attachments and a strong suction cup.	2014-10-28	1774	There are more attachments than I know what to do with (for<br>now).

R15ZU8TB5W18J6	5	Great and Versatile Mount	This suction cup works like a charm!<br />I was going to purchase a cheaper knock off version from amazon but then while I was at my local target i saw the GoPro model on clearance for only six dollars. I jumped on the deal seeing that it was even cheaper than most of the knockoff versions, I even bought two of them. So I take it home open it up and all the contents were packed neatly into the clear plastic packaging and it even came with a small drawstring bag to hold the mount in. Eager to try it out, I set up my GoPro hero3 black and went for a short drive. I was somewhat weary of whether it would hold at first because after all it is just a suction cup, but it held firm the entire ride and even when i tried to intentionally pull it off I couldn't until i applied ridiculous amounts of force to it. After i got home the first thing i did was examine the footage, it looked awesome i had it set at 1080p wide 60 fps and mounted on the sunroof of my car. This is just another great GoPro product that will greatly increase your shot selection. It will stick to practically any piece of glass or relatively smooth flat surface, it wouldn't work on the dashboard of my car but that is a very textured surface. It did however do a great job on the inside of the windshield in my car which is curved.	2014-10-28	1774	This suction cup works like a charm!<br />I was going to<br>purchase a cheaper knock off version from amazon but then while<br>I was at my local target i saw the GoPro model on clearance for<br>only six dollars.

R22Y279LQSUFUF	5	Works like a charm!	Just used this and its awesome! Super strong hold and works like a charm. I used this for and all day drift competition, speeds ranging from 80-120 mph plus the drifting part. Stayed on like a charm and had super stable video by the end of the day. I used a tether the first time after reading reviews about it failing but after the first time I was no longer afraid it would fail. I strongly believe that the ones that failed weren't mounted correctly to begin with. I mounted it 10 different times to several different cars and locations on the cars. If you mount it right it won't fail.<br /><br />The vibrations from drifting in a car had me worried but I am 100% confident in this mount now that I have tested it.<br /><br />This is a perfect buy and worth every penny.<br /><br />Gives you awesome shots and will give you your moneys worth in awesome videos!<br /><br />I'll post a video soon!	2014-10-21	1781	Just used this and its awesome!

It's great because you can easily take it off and use it, unlike the chesty. It has a little of an awkward angle but you have to get used to how to use it in your benefit.	2014-10-20	1782	Money well spent. I use this most out of most of my GoPro<br>accessories.

R3LMWT2QCOQQX5	3	Mount your go pro in the center of your head if mountain biking	It is better to mount your go pro right over your forehead.  I thought this would be nice when ducking under trees and such, but all it really does is make your helmet twist when you go over rough terrain.<br /><br />This would work great on the side of a car if you don't mind putting adhesive on your ride.	2014-10-20	1782	It is better to mount your go pro right over your forehead.

R27DJTEHUHF1NX	3	Great tool for cold or wet use but beware - torquing screw down hard is a bad idea.	Great idea for getting a slightly snugger fit when your hands are cold or wet, but I highly discourage anyone from torquing the screws down hard.  Exact same concept as the brake and clutch lever that any experienced dirt bike rider knows.  That would be the following:  Torque levers just enough that they never move during normal usage but so they can still pivot on the bars if you smack them from the top or bottom.  This prevents them from breaking off when you have a low speed &#34;get off&#34; or just fall over.  Same concept with the GoPro camera mount.  Torque it down too hard and when you do whack into something hard enough then something has to give.  I would much prefer having my GoPro pivot over then losing it off the top of my helmet in the middle of the woods because the clamp was so tight that the bracket broke or I ripped the adhesive off.<br /><br />Great concept if used properly, but the description only slightly accurately states that and promotes cranking the screw down.	2014-10-20	1782	Great idea for getting a slightly snugger fit when your hands<br>are cold or wet, but I highly discourage anyone from torquing<br>the screws down hard.

R3ODV6Y5C3UJVT	3	If your dog shakes then expect the straps to fall off	First thing, this fits my catahoula leopard dog perfectly but he does not like having it on his back so he tries numerous times to shake it off. It will not fit small dogs properly so I would say dogs of 45+ lbs could wear this.<br /><br />Second, it's very easy to put on your dog and he should not mind it at first especially if you use a harness to walk him/her.<br /><br />Third, the straps are easily adjustable and come with sleeves to hide any flapping straps.<br /><br />Fourth, there are no buckles and that's a huge problem because when my dog shakes, the main waist strap tends to fall off. The reason it falls is due to the fact that his shaking loosens the straps enough for some to come off.<br /><br />Fifth, the bottom chest plate is useless and uncomfortable for the dog so try to avoid this POV.<br /><br />Sixth, the top plate is the best place for the go pro but it's also lacking proper height so some of the video shots may have too much of the dog's head. A quick adjustment of the camera should fix this.<br /><br />Seventh, stability is actually not that bad but if there is a lot of hyper movements then prepare for some blurriness but not too bad. My dog keeps shaking (will eventually stop once he gets used to it) but the shots were not that bad but the sound is.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />This is $60+ accessory and they skimp out on proper buckling? My dog may not like having the fetch on him but it does not hinder any of his movements and it's not too tight. He rarely wears a leash or a collar so he prefers to be free that way. While he does not try to scratch it off, I am concerned that if he ever does then he might easily remove all straps so buckles would be nice.	2014-10-19	1783	First thing, this fits my catahoula leopard dog perfectly but he<br>does not like having it on his back so he tries numerous times<br>to shake it off.

R39028Z2A6QJCU	1	Headstrap Mount couldn't even keep GoPro in place while walking.	Opened up the package and tested it in the house and the camera wouldn't even stay pointing straight. The weight of the camera while walking was enough for it to rotate down and point at my face. I tried tightening the screw to the point where I could barely get it unscrewed and it still would not stay in place. The extra quick clip kept the GoPro stuck in place. Couldn't even move it with force. Gravity was too much for the headstrap mount.	2014-10-19	1783	Opened up the package and tested it in the house and the camera<br>wouldn't even stay pointing straight.

R3FUETYEQX867P	4	Probably good but needs additional adhesive	So I can't really comment on whether or not it works b/c I just returned from a dive trip where I'd hoped to use it, but couldn't.  I didn't realize that the two back doors it came with are different sizes, so I stuck the floaty to one of the back doors, but then tried to attach it only to realize it doesn't fit my Hero 3+.  I was able to remove the floaty with some effort, but now I don't have another sticky (it only came with one, it should really come with two) to adhere it to the correct door.  I'm trying to find out how to get another adhesive so I can still use it...otherwise it's pretty much a wasted purchase.  Seems like it would work great, but providing two back doors and not two adhesive strips has left me with a floaty out of water.  I'll update this if I can ever use it and report to its function.	2014-10-15	1787	So I can't really comment on whether or not it works b/c I just<br>returned from a dive trip where I'd hoped to use it, but<br>couldn't.

Its an excellent mount and has lots of adjustments.  Just make sure you mount it on a flat surface, push down on the black center piece until the locking mechanism rises, then lock it down, it is amazingly strong.	2014-10-14	1788	I love this mount.

R1YZGK4T21M20A	5	Effective head strap	It came adjusted to my head size. How did they know? This is a well made head strap that you can wear bare-headed, on a cap or large-brimmed hat. Haven't tried it on a helmet yet. Mine came with a cap brim clip as an extra accessory. If you use the latter, the camera tends to pull your cap off, so cinch up the cap tightly at the back.	2014-10-13	1789	It came adjusted to my head size. How did they know?

I did the same thing for 4 hours of hiking to Machu Picchu during the pouring rain in insane humidity.	2014-10-13	1789	They work, but it turns out they do nothing that a couple pieces<br>of rolled up toilet paper can't do.

R3US0DLQJFJ8R5	1	Looks great, functions poorly	Initial thoughts -- still testing.    Out of the box this harness looks great.  I put it on the dog and spent a few minutes adjusting until it looked just right.  However, with the camera mounted, the harness lists to one side.  I have adjusted it numerous times and this continues.  I have noticed that the straps loosen very quickly so adjusting the snugness is ineffective because it will not maintain.    I also put it on my dog to just wear around the house without the camera to see how it held up.  He scratched and unhooked the belly strap.  There is nothing to keep the straps in place, they just hook on.  So if he's running around outdoors and brushes against things, he could easily unhook a strap that way as well.    My fear is that, off leash, he could lose this harness.  Plus, I can't get video that is not crooked because the camera / harness will list to one side.  I plan to test this some more and see if  I cannot overcome this but it might require modification to the harness and I don't see the point in paying this much for something that I have to modify to make it work.  I might as well make my own harness mount if that is the case.    If I overcome these drawbacks, I'll update this review.    17 October 14 update    After multiple hikes I found that the harness requires constant readjustment because there is no way to lock the straps at the point you adjust them to.  Straps loosen within minutes and even faster when wet.  It worked a little better on my 46 pound dog than on my 66 pound dog (holding adjustment slightly longer).  I really cannot understand this poor design with no way to properly adjust the straps so that they stay in place.  The straps have no buckles, they hook onto a loop in the strap.  The dog can undo these when running around by brushing against a tree, brush, etc.  This has happened multiple times.      I am considering removing the straps and attaching the platform to something else.	2014-10-11	1791	Initial thoughts -- still testing.    Out of the box this<br>harness looks great.

R274QM34IXMISS	5	great	I use the quick clip much more than the headstrap. Both work as advertised, but I think they should play up the quick clip more. It works for attaching the camera to your hat like they say, but it is also great for attaching it to any kind of webbing or sternum strap, works as a stand on a stable platform, and is also a functional handle that helps to keep your hand out of the frame.<br /><br />The headstrap works as a headstrap, but with a little disassembly and the addition of some webbing can be modified to work as a chest harness or can be strapped to all kinds of things.<br /><br />Too bad they don't sell these parts separately. I'd buy extras of the headstrap center piece and the quick clip.	2014-10-11	1791	I use the quick clip much more than the headstrap.

RQ2XKJ3P442TM	5	It's Awesome!	This thing is awesome!  I had read mixed reviews about the knock off brand suction cup mounts so I went with the GoPro brand mount and I'm glad I did.  So far I've had my GoPro mounted to the front of the Jetski bouncing across the Chesapeake Bay and got some good dolphin footage and I've also stuck it on the front of my Harley riding hundreds of miles on the interstate and have never had an issue.  This thing literally locks on to whatever you stick it to.  Last weekend I stuck it to my sons helmet and he took his dirt bike for a spin and got some pretty good video out of it.  As long as the surface is clean and you take the time to put it on properly, I don't think this suction cup is going to come off. I do still put a safety lanyard on it when on the bike or jetski for safety reasons but this thing has never failed yet.	2014-10-09	1793	This thing is awesome!

R31CAFLU28M1V7	5	Most amazing product ever!!!	This is the most awesome product ever invented!!! Anything you are doing can be professionally videoed and then just plug into your PC or TV and you have the best movie EVER. Simple to operate. From opening the box to using the Go Pro takes about 5 minutes. Very EASY for the novice to take professional looking video. I for see ALOT of people using the Go Pro in place of professional photographers that charge so much for events like weddings, birthdays and special holiday or family reunions. Now you are in control of your own video and it's hands-free and very lightweight and comfortable, you forget that you even have it on. When you're done you can plug it in to the t.v or pc while everyone is still there and it is a blast to watch. We have had so much fun with this little camera and soon to purchase additional san disks for more memory and a few other accessories. And it's waterproof, you can take it on the boat and underwater. Amazing. We Love it.	2014-10-02	1800	This is the most awesome product ever invented!!!

R1OWB3AK5GQ8WA	4	this is an awesome product. Second off	This is my first review ever, so bear with me.<br /><br />First off, this is an awesome product.  Second off, if you're expecting to get a smooth, crystal clear video that looks like the videos of someone surfing, that's not going to happen.  Dogs shake, then run, they jump, they bounce... they do a lot of things that make the camera shake.<br /><br />That being said, a dog of about 40 pounds with a wider back would be perfect for this.  Mine is about 25 pounds and it ALMOST fits him perfectly.  I have to tighten the straps a lot and take off the chest plate but it stays on very well and it comfortable for him.  Until he starts shaking like all dogs too, the camera stays pretty tightly on his back.  If your dog can be off leash, this is a MUCH BETTER product.  If your dog needs to stay on leash, you're almost always going to be pulling his collar causing the camera to slide to the side on your dogs back.<br /><br />The video is excellent, as it all go pro videos.  Be prepared to adjust the straps every time your dog runs and turns too quickly causing the camera to slide off their back.<br /><br />I realize this isn't a perfect product, and for a second round, I'd suggest building the mount about 3 inches higher to get above the dogs head.  Aside from that, you can get some GREAT videos from this.  You can't use the chest mount if you have a small dog, it's too bulky for the dog and they'll just mess with it.  A lot of fun footage with this toy!	2014-09-29	1803	This is my first review ever, so bear with me.<br /><br />First<br>off, this is an awesome product.

REESAZ3NXHWDH	5	We have had it a month and love this harness	We've been waiting for a harness that could fit our cockapoos (22lbs) for tracking!  They are really talented little dogs and we've wanted to be able to show off their talents.  We have had it a month  and love this harness.  We spent all morning out today using our GoPro to capture video of tracking.  There are a few things to note (even though we give it a 5 star rating)  - for small dogs you really can't use the chest mount.  It bumps their legs as they move.  I suspect on a larger dog this would not be an issue.  The wide angle lens really captures a lot.  One minus is that there is no leash attachment.  We are going to add a D-ring to ours.  We use a harness for tracking and couldn't put both the fetch and their other harness on at the same time. It also seemed to loosen a little as the dog ran.  Our one dog really wasn't in to having the extra weight on its back, so we used the human chest strap for his tracks.  It seems to work just as well.  If you are considering the fetch for tracking you may also want to check out that product.  That being said, this  product worked EXCELLENT for our one dog and the quality of video is SUPERB!	2014-09-28	1804	We've been waiting for a harness that could fit our cockapoos<br>(22lbs) for tracking!

These are a bit more money but also is a case of you get what you pay for.  I didn't really mount these to a tripod, seems kind of silly for that, but I did use it with some homemade mounts I created with 1/4-20 bolts.  Not hard to make your own mounts if you love hanging around the hardware store with a creative mind.	2014-09-22	1810	If you want to mount your GoPro to any sort of tripod mount<br>these are the ones to get.

The camera snaps in tight and she can't shake it loose. The harness allows you to mount the camera on her back or on her chest area. We mount the camera on her back. I don't think the harness is uncomfortable for her but she reacted to it like she does her winter coat (kinda like she doesn't want to wear it) and at first she tries to shake it off. Then she settles down and it does not[[ASIN:B00N31FQJS GoPro Fetch (Dog Harness)]] bother her.

ROYBZZS902R3C	4	GoPro Mount Holds Well, but Limited Degrees of Freedom	Holds rock solid, but the degrees of freedom on this thing is limited.  I found myself having to figure out with the supplied pieces how my desired orientation and mounting location of the base could work.  This took more time than the time it takes to mount.  Most of the time I just mounted my GoPro onto the base with none of the other arms attached.  The base has a nice button to get the suction down and a lever to lock it.  I've used other windshield mounting devices and I have to say that this design is very easy to place and remove (no iron grip struggles).  I mounted it on the inside of the windshield so I can't say how well it holds outside of the car.  Would be nice if the mount allowed the camera to be swiveled around.	2014-09-20	1812	Holds rock solid, but the degrees of freedom on this thing is<br>limited.

R2X2G1D1JNSKYR	1	Great idea.....HORRIBLE execution	I'm a big fan of GoPro and have several cameras, and almost all of their various mounts. So I was happy to see that they had finally come out with this harness.<br /><br />Then I got it. I've used it twice, and to put it bluntly, this is a product that should have never seen the light of day in its current form. And I would love to know what kind of testing this was put through.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; when compared to the other harness I have (Kurgo) it provides a relatively stable platform for shooting from your dog's back. Provided, of course, your dog doesn't do anything crazy....like running, or swimming, or God forbid, shaking itself after it gets out of the water. Or, you know, just shakes itself because that's what dogs do.<br /><br />And if THAT happens, then you can be like me and wade into a river to retrieve the harness that she shook loose. I've already lost one GoPro attached to a drone; seeing another one float down the river because my dog shook out of her harness? Pass.<br /><br />Here are the specifics of why this thing sucks and I will be sending it back after two uses. The first one was yesterday, when I took her swimming, and found that I had to put her front legs back through the front straps when she came back to shore because of all that crazy swimming thing. So I thought, &#34;Okay, then we'll only use if for our walks by the river.&#34; And then I got to go wading, so no, it's no good for walking either.<br /><br />But being a former product manager, I know that in order to make this thing better than the abortion it is now, I need to provide specifics.<br /><br />Let's start with the hook and loop idea for closures. Again, this would be ideal for the discerning dog prancing at Westminster I guess, but for a dog who is running back and forth, twisting and generally acting like a dog, this type of closure is guaranteed to come off. And that shaking thing is a guarantee that at least the belly band is going to come off.<br /><br />Thenthere's the idea of using elastic material for every strap. Again, if your dog walks in a perfectly straight line and doesn't do anything whack like do a 180 because there's a wonderful smell, or there's another dog nearby, then you will probably be okay. In fact, as I think about it maybe GoPro should market this as an accessory for the urban dog on the go, the poodle that's on its way to its grooming maybe. Otherwise, in a fairly short period of time the harness has slid all the way down to just above the tail.<br /><br />The friction binding of the hooks keeps the straps from loosening...as long as none of those conditions I just described apply. Or if you can teach your dog to hold its breath for several minutes at a time; you can always retighten them between takes I guess.<br /><br />The strap placement seems pretty awkward to me, although when I asked my Yellow Lab she really didn't say much. But with that bellyband, if your dog has a very deep but relatively narrow chest, it seems to be a given that it is going to slide down to just under the ribcage. And, again, while she doesn't say much, the way she was walking around all hunched up looking like a greyhound needing to do its business makes me think that it's probably not that comfortable.<br /><br />All in all this seems very much like a product GoPro threw together on a desktop machine, said, &#34;Looks good&#34;, and then threw it out onto the market. But it's not only not ready for primetime, I can't even recommend it for late night infomercial time.<br /><br />Sorry.	2014-09-15	1817	I'm a big fan of GoPro and have several cameras, and almost all<br>of their various mounts.

RRC8GKAEEUIIL	5	Wow!  Another High Quality GoPro Product!	This is easily the best GoPro mount i have purchased.  I bought it to use on my boat and it was been great.  The suction cup holds no matter how fast we are going or how bumpy the lake has gotten, even when stuck to the outside of the boat!  Also, the versatility of this mount is amazing.  No matter where I stick the suction cup, I'm able to adjust the mounts arm direction and tilt to get the perfect shot.  This is clearly a very well thought out and well made product.  In my experience, GoPro makes very high quality products and this one is no exception.	2014-09-15	1817	This is easily the best GoPro mount i have purchased.

RYUTRDS204EOE	4	Works with my Black Lab	[[VIDEOID:mo3VGNZICZ1WMT3]]I have a 8 year old black lab named Brudis. At first I thought this was going to be a nightmare to put on, but I was able to do it in under 2 minutes the very first time. Brudis loves to wear this. I think it makes him feel like he has a job. The quality over all is pretty good. It stays straight for the most part, but with all the running, hitting trees, and running into misc. things, you will have to make adjustments or straiten it back out. As for the footage, the top mount is way better than the bottom mount. The bottom footage is really shaky, clunky from the dogs legs or what not. The top mount gives a good POV of the dogs head and what they're getting into. I would recommend using superview 1080p by 60fps, just because dogs run fast! I've tested in the water and it seems to dry within 5 hours or so. It's also a real head turner. Having your dog go up to strangers and get petted, just seeing their reaction is priceless. I give it a 4 out of 5 bc I do have to adjust it every so often, a hard thing to get around. I would only recommend this for medium to large dogs. This will not work on the taco bell dog.	2014-09-13	1819	[[VIDEOID:mo3VGNZICZ1WMT3]]I have a 8 year old black lab named<br>Brudis.

R2089TFQJ2KTQ3	5	Nice!	What an incredibly useful device!  I really love the flexibility that this offers.  I strongly advise that anyone using this purchase a few different size safety cables.

My one complaint is that it will not stick for more than a minute to the epoxy paint on the walls where I work.	2014-09-11	1821	What an incredibly useful device!

It did not hold well at all on a kayak, but it's due to the slightly curved surface and the texture of the plastic.  As long as you remember to clean the attachment area well and press down on the latch on the suction cup, this will hold tightly at highway speeds (you may want to tether it, unless you want your camera going on a trip of its own). If you put it where there are strong winds it may vibrate a little, but for the most part, it's stable.	2014-09-10	1822	In a good way, of course.<br /><br />I've attached this mount to<br>a variety of panels on my car and it's held very well.

One of those caps with the plastic bands that is sizable or even a velcro strap all have the same flaw as far as this quickclip mount goes. There is a big hole in the baseball cap just above the band, and that is were the quickclip is suppose to get all its support and clip onto the cap at. So I can not recomened this quickclip unless you have a fitted baseball cap. If you happen to have a fitted baseball cap like i did just lying around, this works great :)	2014-09-04	1828	I bought this strictly for the quick clip baseball camp mount.

R19EJG27ERDE57	1	Shaky Cam 9,000	"In February of 2013 I posted a video of my Dog \\""Freyja\\"" to the Gopro FB playing fetch in the waters of Hawaii. She was wearing a homemade gopro dog harness and the video ended up being the most successful viral video I have ever been a part of. It was only 10K likes and hundreds of comments but needless to say I was proud that my dogs brought that much enjoyment to others. A news company even contacted me to try and get rights to the video. Recently I saw this harness came out and I was beyond stoked. I have been using my homemade harness for the past two years and this one just looked nicer and more professional.    Unfortunately, looking good is all this thing can really do. It is a useless harness that merely holds the camera to a dog. Dont expect your dog to be able to do much with it on. It shakes constantly and will never yield good video results. I wish I got a copyright when I made the harness the first time a few years ago. I don't want money but I want this thing to be made correctly. As of right now its just a scam. You cannot get good video with it on unless your dog is boring. The mount just does not have the needed surface area to stay steady. However, you can purchase this mount and sew it to a reliable dog vest to get much better results.    In my opinion, just make one yourself and dont waste your money on this thing.    Respectfully,  a dog enthusiast who spends all his free time recording his dogs doing amazing things.    This is literally the only thing I have ever been compelled to write a negative review on.

R30RXZXJL9LABU	5	Simple solution, works perfect.	This accessory is sort of an insurance policy when you take your GoPro diving.  I took this diving with a POV pole attached and while it didn't have enough added buoyancy to float with the pole attached, it make the sinking speed MUCH slower.  When the GoPro camera is by itself or with a small surfing clip, it'll float to the surface easily.<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I can think to gripe about is that it comes in pieces, so you are left to have to attach the sticky tape to the GoPro's backdoor.  When I did it, I placed it too high such that the water proof case's clamp snags the top of the floaty material when I close it up.  Minor, but I would double check if I did it again, so definitely check the clamp's fit when you attach yours.	2014-08-31	1832	This accessory is sort of an insurance policy when you take your<br>GoPro diving.

RV6OADPLSSB0T	5	Amazing suction	I've used suction cup mounts for satellite radio and other car accessories, which were all mediocre and I could count on falling off at some point.

Seriously, I think I could probably stick it on the ceiling and mount a pull up bar on it.

R1KR162N7UFAG	3	Needed item	Disappointed in this item.  I thought I could charge a battery outside the camera with this charger. I'm sure the description was clear and it was my misunderstanding.  Another attachment is necessary for charging battery outside of your camera....more gadgets more money. You have to have something to charge it, so it's fine for charging while the battery is in your camera.	2014-08-29	1834	Disappointed in this item.

R27KKHIWTGISM1	2	Not a big help at the beach.	I'm pretty sure that my Hero 3 Black is failing as it seems to overheat.  This likely exacerbates the condensation problem inside the case.  Still, after two weeks at the beach, I found that I was routinely thwarted from filming in the waves by fog-up inside the case even though I used two of the inserts.  I'm not sure I understood exactly how to make sure they were fresh other than buying them brand new and using them right away.  The instructions were lacking and a little vague.  Should I put them in the oven to start or just after they've been used.

R1PC0I992GV1UF	1	Leak Scare make sure your case seal is tight	Placed fog inserts into Hero 3+ waterproof casing. It caused the seal to stretch just enough to allow water inside. I was filming underwater at a pool at night when I noticed my record light had disappeared but blue wireless light flickered like a strobe light. So I held up casing sure enough soaked in water. Panic time I prompltly took out camera opened up battery case shook out as much water as possible tried starting it up after 3 hour wait. I used a fully charged battery that was not soaked. The record and wifi light flickered and the unit would not power up. So next my wife tries the buried in dry rice overnight after blow drying the camera for 20 minutes on low heat to avoid heat damage. The next day like a miracle the camera worked again flawlessly. I had given up all hope and figured I had a useless camera. Anyway the one star is for the fog inserts not the camera.	2014-08-14	1849	Placed fog inserts into Hero 3+ waterproof casing.

I've successfully used it on multiple occasions in the Pacific Ocean, and although the current *can* be an issue, it's generally fine if you're floating along with it. I've gotten some amazing underwater footage, and not had to worry at all about potentially losing my $300 GoPro Hero3+. For just a few dollars, I've bought myself a whole lot of peace of mind. I'd recommend this to anyone that goes in the water--I'm sure it would perform even better in a pool!<br /><br />This also comes with a dedicated waterproof backdoor (so you don't have to put it on the one that came with your camera), and was very easy to install. The adhesive, to me, seems extremely secure. Great product!	2014-08-11	1852	This Floaty Backdoor is great.

R1XE7862XWKMM6	5	Floats camera... Without any mounts.	Floats camera well and is very visible. Stays on securely.... Only problem is that if you have another mount; such as a monopod, suction cup, etc attached to the camera when it falls in the water it will still sink.<br />This back door will only float the camera, it's not floaty enough to float a mount to. I have the go pro brand suction cup and it sinks fast with the floaty back door on it.<br />Make sure you tether well...<br />Another option... I cut a bright yellow pool noodle and slipped it over the arm of the suction cup. So I have the pool noodle, floaty back door and a tether. Overkill, maybe, but after 17 days at the lake; I still have my camera.	2014-08-09	1854	Floats camera well and is very visible.

If the inside of the cup picks up too much dirt from a dirty car, it wont stick to a clean car until it's cleaned up.	2014-08-08	1855	I've used these extensively on patrol cars to video driver<br>training for law enforcement instruction.

This comes with the floaty part, and two new back doors. One for the old GoPro and one for the new GoPro case. So it will be compatible with yours.

R1R7VACV2E87	1	Not up to GoPro's typical standard.	This was miserable, it SHATTERED into pieces after the first tumble. It just doesn't seem like GoPro really put their typical engineering into this mount.  The first thing I noticed was it's bulk, it just really isn't elegant like most products from GoPro. The second thing i noticed was how challenging it was mount on something non-stationary like a ski pole or things like that.  I would look for other alternatives before I would spend my $ on this if I were you.	2014-08-05	1858	This was miserable, it SHATTERED into pieces after the first<br>tumble.

The GOPRO parts are far superior. I use this for charging other devices because it is a 1500 MA charger versus the other stuff being a 500MA. That means it charges 3 times faster. Also I bout another charger with a thrid party battery and it lasts 20 minutes instead of the Gopro baterry being 30 minutes. The other stuff may be cheaper, but the genuine stuff is much better.	2014-08-04	1859	I am learning that there is a difference between Gopro parts and<br>other parts made for gopro's.

R12I51Y7WQAVEN	1	Do not use with helmet.	This particular strap has done nothing but cause me trouble. First of all the way Amazon breaks down multiple orders is confusing and I ended up paying over a hundred dollars on shipping. That was Amazons fault and my fault for not combing through everything more closely. The online merchant was kind enough to make an exception and refund me some money.<br /><br />This strap was the ruination of a very expensive GoPro. I bought the Hero+ 3 black and that is a lot of money. Well I had the strap secured onto my helmet and the helmet strap shot off like a rubber band. Even though I made sure all the straps were down low and under the lip of the helmet. The car that was following too closely behind me ran it over and that was 500 plus dollars down the drain.<br /><br />Being completely new to the camera and attachment market, I later learned that there is a different kind of attachment for the helmet. I will say that this worked for several weeks but then there was just that one day and one day was all it took.	2014-08-04	1859	This particular strap has done nothing but cause me trouble.<br>First of all the way Amazon breaks down multiple orders is<br>confusing and I ended up paying over a hundred dollars on<br>shipping.

RB0U9LMBMN7YY	1	Broke on first use.	we added this to our wedding registry, and were very excited when we received it. However on out first time using it- the power button broke off- making it no longer water proof or even useable. We were actually out of the country on our honeymoon- and were no longer able to use the camera under water to record our snorkeling adventures- the entire reason we bought the gopro to begin with. Thankfully there was no damage to our gopro- however I do not have enough faith in this product to risk it again. I think we will be returning for a refund.	2014-07-27	1867	we added this to our wedding registry, and were very excited<br>when we received it.

R2P9WV4XURKC3Y	5	Awsome, works exactly like it should.	Works perfectly... I attached a small handle to hold it under water for snorkeling and it still stayed afloat. It comes with 2 different size doors for either of the gopro's and it also has a tether. you can also just let the gopro float while you swim under it.

Comes with two doors for different GoPro versions.<br /><br />One star loss since I was hoping it would not be as thick (an inch or so) and if you have two different versions, this is a permanent stickon to your backdoor. You could use some Scots Velcro to attach and move around. Maybe a product suggestion? That way you also don't have to constantly replace the door.	2014-07-27	1867	Great float.

R37IIO2RIXQSKP	2	It will work fine if you want to mount to a quick release	I bought the gooseneck accessory because I needed a long neck to mount my gopro upside down from my car roof.  I wanted the camera to shoot my track day session between the dash and the rear view mirror.  I cannot mount to my dash or the windshield and the last time I mounted with only the suction cup, the rear view mirror blocked much of the track.  Unfortunately, the description on this product is misleading.  The description states the gooseneck will attach to any mount...including the suction cup...this is not correct.  There is a quick release male &#34;foot&#34; on one end and a female quick release &#34;foot&#34; on the other end.  The gopro suction cup has neither of these adapters to fit.  I have other accessories too, but nothing will fit either end of this accessory with my suction cup.  It will work fine if you want to mount to a quick release, otherwise don't get this if you plan on mounting with the suction cup.	2014-07-26	1868	I bought the gooseneck accessory because I needed a long neck to<br>mount my gopro upside down from my car roof.

R3FY4UJ55WF8B2	5	Strong suction, great truck mount!	Used this on my truck while off roading on a recent camping/off road trip.  Very pleased with it.  Suction is strong, the arms allow for wide range of movement.  I was worried about it scratching my truck but it hardly moved.  Only time it fell off was during a particular rough trail while hopping over rocks, I had it mounted on the lower side of my door and I think between gravity and the bumps it finally lost suction and took a spill.  Luckily my spotter noticed it before I ran it over!	2014-07-26	1868	Used this on my truck while off roading on a recent camping/off<br>road trip.  Very pleased with it.

R1CB6UISIEJGK9	4	A necessary item if you're using your GoPro in the water	Since GoPro cameras aren't bouyant, this product is a necessity if you are going to use your GoPro in the water.  You just stick the foam flotation part to the back door of the waterproof camera housing and replace the door onto housing.  The camera and housing then become positively buoyant so your camera doesn't sink to the bottom. I got this on sale and it seemed very reasonable priced.  I recommend this for anyone who will be using their GoPro in the water.	2014-07-25	1869	Since GoPro cameras aren't bouyant, this product is a necessity<br>if you are going to use your GoPro in the water.

I left it attached to our kitchen table overnight, the next morning it was still stuck. However, because I'm not made of money and would hate to loose it, I would never trust it in a dangerous location like the hood of a car on the interstate, the side of a sky scraper on the 100th floor or on top of a plane while in flight.	2014-07-14	1880	Holly suction cups batman!

R1TRC04CMP4QNG	5	Necessary piece of equipment	I wanted more reassurance when i have my GoPro Hero 3 Silver on my head mount and this did it. Since it is so thick though, you cannot get a flush angle while on your head. That being said, this mount was not necessarily made to accommodate a head mount. But it has saved my butt plenty of times!

R1FS5QCDWWOI	5	Perfect for the ocean	I purchased on this on vacation to take it snorkeling while In Hawaii as a recommendation from a couple we had met earlier on in the week who had used it while surfing.<br /><br />The day before going snorkeling my wife and I tested it out in both our hotel's pool and the ocean, just off the beach. We wanted to make sure that it worked before taking it into the deep ocean where we might not have been able to get it back if we dropped it. All I can say is that it worked great!<br /><br />On our snorkeling trip I was able to let go of it on occasion when I had to readjust my mask and it would safely float around nearby. It wasn't so buoyant that I had problems diving with it.  Two thumbs up to the GoPro floaty from me.<br /><br />It also comes with some connectors that you can stick on and connect at tassle to in order to connect it to your wrist if needed. If you want though, you could just take off any mount you have attached and thread something through the holes where the mount goes. Just an idea.	2014-07-02	1892	I purchased on this on vacation to take it snorkeling while In<br>Hawaii as a recommendation from a couple we had met earlier on<br>in the week who had used it while surfing.<br /><br />The day<br>before going snorkeling my wife and I tested it out in both our<br>hotel's pool and the ocean, just off the beach.

R3QCUUZ9MOWAIA	5	great product	easy to install and floats great.  we bought it for paddle board and pool.  the only issues is once you put on, its not suppose to come off, unless you swap the back plate.  not a big deal.  but for control area, like a pool, i want the gopro to sink to bottom so it can record a dive.  i'll just have to swap back plates instead.  still a great product.	2014-07-02	1892	easy to install and floats great.  we bought it for paddle board<br>and pool.  the only issues is once you put on, its not suppose<br>to come off, unless you swap the back plate.  not a big deal.<br>but for control area, like a pool, i want the gopro to sink to<br>bottom so it can record a dive.  i'll just have to swap back<br>plates instead.  still a great product.

R1LGT7A4PDGEK5	5	Paris Hilton couldn't get this much suction.	The title of this review says all you need to know about this product. It's the real deal; like Philiy cheesestake cheese whiz, Marilyn Monroe and JFK, JellyBelly ear wax real deal. Stick on the outside of your car, or on the inside. Stick it on the microwave above your stove while you make a delicious meal. Got a mirror above your bed? 'Nuff said. Stick it, bop it, kick it...no wrong thing. Yes, I know what you are thinking. We all want to see what it would like to have a camera on the outside of your car, filming as you drive around screaming your favorite Lady Gaga &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; song at the top of your lungs. Like no one around has a clue as to your undertakings. So, enough wasting time, purchase this suction cup that gives your friendly, local street-corner aficionado a run for his/her money (I don't discriminate).<br /><br />In all seriousness - It sometimes tends to record a little off angle, so use the phone app to look at the preview and get the straightest angle you can (if that bothers you, because it bothers me). Time lapse while driving can get you car sick, so take some dramamine if you plan on editing a lot of time lapse footage.	2014-06-19	1905	The title of this review says all you need to know about this<br>product.

Stick it on<br>the microwave above your stove while you make a delicious meal.<br>Got a mirror above your bed? 'Nuff said. Stick it, bop it, kick<br>it...no wrong thing. Yes, I know what you are thinking. We all<br>want to see what it would like to have a camera on the outside<br>of your car, filming as you drive around screaming your favorite<br>Lady Gaga &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; song at the top of your<br>lungs. Like no one around has a clue as to your undertakings.<br>So, enough wasting time, purchase this suction cup that gives<br>your friendly, local street-corner aficionado a run for his/her<br>money (I don't discriminate).<br /><br />In all seriousness - It<br>sometimes tends to record a little off angle, so use the phone<br>app to look at the preview and get the straightest angle you can<br>(if that bothers you, because it bothers me). Time lapse while<br>driving can get you car sick, so take some dramamine if you plan<br>on editing a lot of time lapse footage.

R10K8NQQW091NE	4	The head strap is fine but the quick clip isn't really a clip	I mainly purchased this as I mistakenly thought the clip was actually like an alligator clip with some sort of spring but that is my own fault for not looking more closely at the pictures that in hindsight clearly show it is a clip designed to slide on to a visor or similar so keep that in mind. Otherwise the head strap itself does what it is designed to do but I find that POV only useful for very specific tasks so it doesn't get much use as I usually have it mounted at chest/shoulder level for hiking using the helmet strap around the shoulder strap of my backpack.	2014-06-14	1910	I mainly purchased this as I mistakenly thought the clip was<br>actually like an alligator clip with some sort of spring but<br>that is my own fault for not looking more closely at the<br>pictures that in hindsight clearly show it is a clip designed to<br>slide on to a visor or similar so keep that in mind.

R18QNVSSYB1PEF	5	Looks great, fits great	Got this as insurance so I dont lose my gopro while using it in the water. Its not too bulky and it definitely gets the job done. Best part is it comes with an extra back so you dont have to completely commit to having this on your gopro forever. Just switch it in and out for when you need it. The bright orange color is great for spotting it in a sea of blue and green	2014-06-13	1911	Got this as insurance so I dont lose my gopro while using it in<br>the water.

RUO275W0FGSBX	5	Just what I needed	I was needing a good strong suction cup in order to do some boat hull mounted photography and airplane wing mounted photography. This product is high-quality and works excellent for both applications. Mind you, the airplane wing mount is on a DeHavillad Beaver floatplane. This plane only flies at about 110 mph or so. This speed is well within the advertised 150 mile-per-hour rating.	2014-06-13	1911	I was needing a good strong suction cup in order to do some boat<br>hull mounted photography and airplane wing mounted photography.<br>This product is high-quality and works excellent for both<br>applications.

R85SWGO51RY3U	4	Beware of Description	I bought that cause I wanted it and it's great cause it's the GoPro brand Floaty Backdoor and shipping was extremely quick. I didn't give five stars because the description and pictures are a little deceiving. In the description it says two adhesive anchors and by looking at the picture you would think that it comes with the white ones pictured in every picture but it's not. They are two black ones that are not used for anything. However great price for the product and shipped very quickly.	2014-06-12	1912	I bought that cause I wanted it and it's great cause it's the<br>GoPro brand Floaty Backdoor and shipping was extremely quick.

R1QD0J93G71050	4	These are standard GoPro mounts, as far as I can tell.

R2QJBJ8OKHC9IO	4	Limited	the suction cup does what it is supposed to do, but it feels very limited. It is hard to get it to stay and small movements are enough to make it break loose.

R2S9OFMRHERN4T	4	A good upgrade for GoPro	Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />The best feature of the LCD is that the menus are much more clear.  No more staring at the front of the camera to read cryptic codes!  It makes the GoPro camera itself easier-to-use, since you can see your subject.<br /><br />It does cause the camera to use more power when the display on, but you can turn off (only) the display to save power and keep shooting.  I found leaving the display on all the time, cut the battery life by ~30 min, down to about 1 hr 20 min.  Consider buying an extra battery pack or 2, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The main con is that the LCD is very hard to see when it's sunny, especially when the camera is underwater (while snorkeling or scuba diving).	2014-06-10	1914	Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />The best feature of the<br>LCD is that the menus are much more clear.

ROBQWJ2PSHGEA	2	Unaware of standard tripod shoes	Standard tripod shoes have this funky pin on a spring that helps detaching the shoe.

R339D6ZOUJAHME	3	it's OK.	It's an okay product considering that you get three options and the price is still low enough for shipping a couple pieces of plastic door to door that I don't feel ripped off.  Knocking off two stars because the compact tripod adapter (the only one I have used out of the three, and the one you'll likely use with your selfie monopod) doesn't tension up enough to keep the camera steady.  I used it daily for about 2 weeks when it stopped working well, now he camera wants to flop forward or backwards.  Looks like I'll have to order another.	2014-06-06	1918	It's an okay product considering that you get three options and<br>the price is still low enough for shipping a couple pieces of<br>plastic door to door that I don't feel ripped off.

R1TK896QYTH7PG	5	Used with Ipow Floating Handle Grip Pole	I used the GoPro Floaty Backdoor and Ipow Floating Handle Grip Pole together for added insurance. You have to stick the floaty on  one of the backdoors they send you; I waited until about an hour before I went swimming in the ocean before I stuck the floaty on the backdoor, thinking I should have done this at least a day before hand, but the floaty stayed on and shows no signs of coming off the backdoor after five separate times in the ocean.	2014-06-06	1918	I used the GoPro Floaty Backdoor and Ipow Floating Handle Grip<br>Pole together for added insurance.

ROSQZJ4SJX8R	5	Works well but bulky	The floaty backdoor does what it's supposed to do - keep your gopro afloat if it drops in the drink.  It adds a lot of bulk, but only a little bit of weight to the camera.

If you're going<br>to be using your camera in a location that you might<br>drop/lose/have it fall of a mount and it could sink to the<br>bottom and be lost forever, this is a wise investment.

R16V0L5XZZZRG0	1	NOT A ROLL BAR MOUNT. DO NOT BUY.	FYI, this is NOT A ROLL BAR MOUNT.

Do NOT purchase this if you want to put it on a roll bar/cage from a UTV or a race car, it won't fit.<br /><br />I will say the shipping was prompt and well oqckaged, even though the item is wrong.	2014-06-03	1921	FYI, this is NOT A ROLL BAR MOUNT.

R34C7TAKCIJBNH	5	Love this!	I wanted the GoPro suction cup as opposed to a 3rd party manufacturer, because I wanted to be confident that it was up to the job. I don't mind buying 3rd party bits n pieces, but for this I wanted OEM. I love this suction cup; it's easy to use, and is apparently rated up to 150mph! It's more expensive than the 3rd party copies, but for an extra $20 I feel confident that my GoPro will still be where I left it when I'm done filming my award-winning death-defying stunts!

Should have came with the purchase a GoPro... but I'm sure they don't mind you having to buy a new camera, in the the event you lose yours. Lol. I would have gave this a 5 star, but it has a small rip (looks to be like an air bubble burst, or slight tear) on the corner of it. My guess is it didn't pass &#34;quality control&#34; inspection and was sold for cheaper, but still does the job.	2014-05-12	1943	To be honest, this is totally worth the money... at least now I<br>don't have to worry about accidentally dropping my camera while<br>filming in the ocean!

R33H1EZG1173N5	4	Functional	This is a 2 mount package for attaching a GoPro camera to a tripod.  One part attaches directly to the camera and screws onto the tripod.  The other part is a GoPro female quick connect tripod mount which screws onto a tripod and will accept the mating male quick connect device (not included) which attaches to the GoPro.  Like all GP mounting stuff, nicely executed but quite expensive for what you get.  If you don't want the quick disconnect piece you can find the tripod to camera mount on Amazon for around $3US.  The quick disconnect devices are nice if you are going to be moving you GP camera often between mounting devices.  My experience with the quick connect system is that it allows for some camera movement since the fit between the male/female parts has to have a small degree of clearance to allow the plastic parts to engage.  This mounting package gets 5 stars on pure functionality and 3 stars for value averaging out to my 4 star overall rating.	2014-04-26	1959	This is a 2 mount package for attaching a GoPro camera to a<br>tripod.

I use this on the glass of the cabs and it holds really well, no extra movement.  I don't think it would go anywhere, but we don't take our chances and use it from the inside only for in-cab videos.  To film outside the cabs, we made a magnet mount that can attach directly to the steel equipment and has superior hold.  Would definitely recommend.	2014-04-24	1961	I just got our GoPro to film our farming/farm related business<br>that uses heavy equipment.

R1F2GKFSDVPX2L	4	Works well	I used the Floaty pad in combination with &#34;The Bobber&#34; handle on a recent boating / snorkeling outing.  The Floaty element of the combination seemed to be well designed.<br /><br />I wanted the pad for floatation during boating. And found the handle helpful during snorkeling.  Either device alone probably would have been more than adequate for flotation.<br /><br />Attaching the Floaty pad:  The Floaty has a large adhesive pad to attach it to the back of the GoPro case.  The Floaty covers essentially the entire back face of the GoPro case, so aligning it when attaching it to the back can be a bit tricky.  You want the pad well centered but don't want it to interfere with the GoPro latch at the top if the case.  What worked well for me was to put the Floaty pad down on a table, adhesive side up.  Then press the provided spare door onto the Floaty pad.  This allows you to look through the clear door as you are attaching it to the pad.  Then remove the original GoPro door and snap this new one into place.  Much easier to control the alignment than trying to press the Floaty onto the full GoPro case.	2014-04-21	1964	I used the Floaty pad in combination with &#34;The Bobber&#34;<br>handle on a recent boating / snorkeling outing.

R11MYAIFF097ST	3	Arrived exhausted!	The anti-fog insert package includes a sensor pad to let you know when the inserts need to be recharged.  The little circle should be the same shade of blue as the reference strip.  The sensor in my package was pink indicating the inserts need to be recharged.  Recharging consists of putting them in the oven for 5 minutes at 300 degrees to remove the moisture.  As they can be recharged 4 times that means I only have 75% of the expected life expectancy.  I don't expect to test these until my next SCUBA trip in May.<br /><br />I'll post back after that trip.	2014-04-17	1968	The anti-fog insert package includes a sensor pad to let you<br>know when the inserts need to be recharged.

RMK84U853B0QH	4	Great, except it needed an SD Card	Giving this 4 stars only because it needed an SD card, but as far as I saw, it didn't mention anything else needed. We bought this as a gift for my brother is a wildlife biologist, who was planning on taking it out early the morning after the scheduled delivery on a cougar hunt. Well, it arrived in the evening and needed an SD card, and my brother lives in the middle of no where, hence the wildlife biologist and cougar hunting...and he couldn't use it :( We would have ordered an SD card, also, had we known.<br /><br />Otherwise, great product as far as we know (brother did not give any complaints) and typical awesome, fast shipping (prime) from Amazon. Will update if/when brother gives feedback.	2014-04-17	1968	Giving this 4 stars only because it needed an SD card, but as<br>far as I saw, it didn't mention anything else needed.

The engineering used by GoPro to attach the various 'backdoors' is just a little 'HOOKEY' - It feels like you're going to break it, no matter how hard you try to be 'gentle'.

RGQVB9YMY5QBA	4	good product	I took this on a trip to thailand and cambodia and was surprised that i used the quick clip more often than the headstrap.  The headstrap needs to be used with a hat or else it makes my hair looks funny.  ha ha.  The quick clip was great because i was able to clip it to my hat.. quickly, as well as my backpack straps (like a chest mount).	2014-03-31	1985	I took this on a trip to thailand and cambodia and was surprised<br>that i used the quick clip more often than the headstrap.

R3Q7FHN369QMYH	5	Wonderful for First-Person Filming	I'm the principle cinematographer for TitleMine, a new web series and YouTube channel that chronicles a math teacher as she travels the country buying and flip exotic cars for profit. Like any professional automotive channel, we use a lot of Hero 3+ black cameras for exterior rolling shots, and a variety of mounts for them.<br /><br />But an issue came up: We wanted to get a relatively novel extend shot of a hill climb from the POV of the driver of our Dodge Viper ACR. We couldn't use the DSLR setup that we use for traditional filming; the ACR's cockpit is very tight with a low ceiling, driving with one of those in front of you or anywhere near your head would be virtually impossible. This head strap was the solution.<br /><br />Robustly stitched with thick, expensive feeling plastic buckles and mounting hinge, the head strap is quick and easy to fit on anybody, and mounting the incredible Hero 3+ Black to the front allowed us to get the raw footage out of protune mode that made for a thrilling, immerseive experience. The footage should be released in a few weeks.<br /><br />Additionally, we were able to take advantage of the enormous amount of snow this winter to take the head strap snowboarding, and it did very well. Even after jumps resulting in about 15-foot elevation changes on impact, the camera stayed tight in its mount and didn't fall forward, and the rubber-backed headband stayed tightly affixed to the rider. The only unfortunate thing about this mount is that it cannot be worn comfortably under a helmet, or securely over one, but you can remedy that easily because each GoPro box includes a bunch of adhesive helmet mounts for the camera that you can use for racing or snowboarding/skiing/skydiving.<br /><br />There is an included clip to mount the camera at a different point on the head strap, or to a belt or something. It seems to work well, but we haven't used it for a shoot yet.<br /><br />One tip for buyers: Use your GoPro LCD or smartphone app with theonboard wifi to properly adjust the camera before every shoot. This is more necessary here than when using the GoPro on the side of a car or something, because the camera needs to be angled down towards your feet to a counter-intuitively high degree to get a natural looking &#34;first person view&#34; from its mounting point.<br /><br />Pros: Works as advertised, well made, comfortable.<br /><br />Cons: None.<br /><br />Verdict: Great buy	2014-03-26	1990	I'm the principle cinematographer for TitleMine, a new web<br>series and YouTube channel that chronicles a math teacher as she<br>travels the country buying and flip exotic cars for profit.

R1BNK6GVL953VO	5	Lots of attachments	My only gripe with this thing is that it doesn't have the ability (that I can figure out, at least) to pivot on two axis.  There are different attachments you can use to pivot on *either* the x or y axis but not both, which can limit your angles if your mounting surface isn't parallel or perpendicular to your shot.	2014-03-26	1990	My only gripe with this thing is that it doesn't have the<br>ability (that I can figure out, at least) to pivot on two axis.<br>There are different attachments you can use to pivot on *either*<br>the x or y axis but not both, which can limit your angles if<br>your mounting surface isn't parallel or perpendicular to your<br>shot.

R2EP7MH5DZFC4	2	Not great for scuba diving	So, I bought this thinking it would work great for diving.  A few problems, though...  It will only hold the GoPro at a 90 degree angle to your arm.  Makes it pretty uncomfortable to use for scuba diving.  But even worse is the housing uses a non-standard size lens.  It is too large to use any standard GoPro Hero 3+ filters or lenses.  Not cool.  If you have a GoPro Hero 3+, save your money and get a simpler wrist strap with just the mount on it.  You already have the underwater housing that came with your GoPro, no need to buy another one just for this strap contraption.	2014-03-24	1992	So, I bought this thinking it would work great for diving.

R3DCARIKZCLF2K	5	Awesome Headstrap!	I love this headstrap! So far I've wore it for a half marathon, kayaking, and snorkeling. All with great results.<br /><br />First of all, the strap is very comfortable. If I wear it above a hat I barely notice it's there. The strap is adjustable so you can get a tight fit and not have to worry about it falling off during filming. I had no problem wearing this during my half marathon, other than the fact I looked like a total nerd...<br /><br />Second, the shaking on the film is not bad. The whole point of getting a GoPro is to see from the actor's perspective. So if I'm running, I expect to see movement. I debated about getting this or the chest strap for running and decided that a headstrap would avoid the back & forth sway (yaw axis) you would get with a chest strap (not to mention your arms getting in the way). I'm very happy with my choice. Checkout the video for the NYC Half: http://youtu.be/IzUJap3Wcqw<br /><br />Third, the quick clip. I don't use it. If I had to buy this again I would just get the cheaper version without the quick clip.<br />Normally the camera is screwed onto a hard plastic plate on the strap. The quick clip clips camera onto the plate, rather than being screwed onto it. I understand the point of the quick clip is to be able to get the GoPro off of your head without taking the whole strap off. I have not used this device because it doesn't look very secure. I would rather take the band off my head since it only takes a second to get it back on. The clip really freaks me out. I'm curious to see if anyone else has had good experience with this thing.<br /><br />Lastly, couple of tips:<br /><br />1: After your GoPro is properly screwed onto the plate on the strap, you can still pivot it to point up or down to get the best filming angle (and then tighten the screw further if there's any slack). I didn't get this right the first time I took it snorkeling with me so I ended up filming ABOVE the water instead of all the amazing fish I saw under the surface.<br /><br />2: If you're filming a long event and can't leave the camera running on your head the whole time because battery power you can obviously get a spare battery. However, if you're running a race and can't finish within time one battery allows, set your on/off to recording, turn your beep to 100% volume and get familiar with the beep pattern on the GoPro. This will allow you to operate your GoPro without looking at the control display and know you're actually filming. Alternatively, you could use the remote or your cellphone, but the wifi would just suck more power out of your camera.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun!e surface.<br /><br />2: If you're filming a long event and can't leave the camera running on your head the whole time because battery power you can obviously get a spare battery.

R2JJKDOYO4LTOQ	5	Great for a trip	I was looking for a charger and an adapter for a trip to Australia. This solved both needs and has the ability to convert again when it goes to Europe. The connections seems ridged and solid and the pieces are well made and finished. The charging part works now but the trip will be the big test. It looks like it was a good deal for what I need.	2014-03-19	1997	I was looking for a charger and an adapter for a trip to<br>Australia.

R2G5ZK2JUWK9XV	4	Nice product but could use ability to swivel camera	I am pleased with the roll bar mount. It fastens securely and seems sturdy. However the ideal mounting position on my car is to a roll bar brace that runs from the center of the roll bar to the side of the car at an angle that is not 90 deg to the center line of the car. With only forward backward and side to side adjustment at 90 degrees I am unable to use this mounting point. I have to mount it to the shoulder harness bar and use about 6 inches of mounting extensions to raise the camera high enough to view out the windshield. The added length between the bar clamp and the camera increases vibration of the camera. A way to swivel the camera position to allow mounting to roll bar sections that are not at 90 degrees (or parallel) to the center line of the car would be very helpful.	2014-03-18	1998	I am pleased with the roll bar mount.

R1I116VT4ER7N6	5	This thing really SUCKS, in a good way!	Item came in it's own little black bag, which was an added touch. I have yet to test it out fully, but it holds VERY well. I was able to stick it to a relatively heavy wood table, and it would not budge.	2014-03-18	1998	Item came in it's own little black bag, which was an added<br>touch.

R1QLJOO8RCN24Y	5	The Floatie	I have no problems with this item.  It was easy to install and it appears the sticky thingy will not come off easily.  I have not yet tested the floating capacity of this item, but from the look and feel of it, I don't think it will have a problem keeping the camera afloat, if I ever drop it or lose control of it in the water.	2014-03-17	1999	I have no problems with this item.

R2R9D3S4UOQVTG	5	Very usable mount!!!	We immediately put it to use and it is a regular for us.  Let's see now:  If we buy a wider collar for the dog, will it stay on him as he, quite literally, runs like the wind after the ball we throw?  Nah, probably not, so we'll find a way to mount it to his harness instead.  :-)	2014-03-17	1999	We immediately put it to use and it is a regular for us.

RTWGRNUKN6C1M	4	Nice accessory for the GoPro camera	This little device allows you to secure a GoPro camera case to any device that has the standard single screw tripod style bolt.  Nice if you need to mount your GoPro to a camera tripod or an extension arm.  I use it on an telescoping camera extension to get over or around obstacles in the way of recording.	2014-03-17	1999	This little device allows you to secure a GoPro camera case to<br>any device that has the standard single screw tripod style bolt.<br>Nice if you need to mount your GoPro to a camera tripod or an<br>extension arm.

R12953AKMR7REJ	1	Bye Bye Gopro...	Bought two of this for two GoPros to do some filming in the water to make sure I didn't lose them. Jumped about 6 feet into the water, it came right off and the GoPro sunk out of sight. Tried to contact GoPro for support and was told essentially that it isn't possible for these to fall off and it was probably my fault. I'd like to think that I'm not a complete moron and am capable of following basic directions.<br /><br />So much for their legendary customer support.	2014-03-16	2000	Bought two of this for two GoPros to do some filming in the<br>water to make sure I didn't lose them.

R249VEULB6MJKL	3	Not for scuba diving	Bought the Floaty for scuba diving and it doesn't float below 65'.  Sinks because the foam is compressed with water pressure below that.  Still use it to avoid accidental GoPro death falling out of the boat or getting in the water.  Just don't depend on to float the camera when scuba diving.	2014-03-16	2000	Bought the Floaty for scuba diving and it doesn't float below<br>65'.

R1RYAMP96OT229	2	Necessary evil?	If you are a stickler for keeping your lens clean or the lens port of your housing clean these inserts are terrible.  They generate a smudgy dust that coats the body of the camera, LCD screen and interior of the housing.  They are fragile and are easily deformed when closing the housing and that appears to release even more dust.  But if you are diving in relatively cool water these could prevent fogging .  They worked to prevent fogging in Crystal River, FL and Paradise Springs, FL where the waters are about 71 degrees.  This product really needs to be improved.  I'm going to try the off brand next for comparison.	2014-03-15	2001	If you are a stickler for keeping your lens clean or the lens<br>port of your housing clean these inserts are terrible.

R24OG9PNF9T7C0	3	Works but w/Shortcomings	Whole thing, with all it's parts and there are plenty, is based on a flat glass surface and right angles.  You'd think there would be a ball and socket thing to accommodate curved windshields but nope!  I have a Land Rover and any position, on the front wind shield, other than center will give you a crooked picture and since all the attachments are based on right angles there is NO WAY to correct!<br /><br />Speaking of attachments . . . don't ever drink before you try to figure out which is the perfect attachment for your situation.  You'll give up!  Being sober takes long enough!  Again, a ball and socket arrangement would solve this problem.	2014-03-15	2001	Whole thing, with all it's parts and there are plenty, is based<br>on a flat glass surface and right angles.

R30IO1MYP5K0RD	5	Perfect for snorkeling and surfing	Bought this for a trip to Hawaii to use with my Silver 3+. Definitely the correct, official GoPro housing.

R1SWD043HHE9F	5	Absolutely great	There is really no need to talk much about a product with such a reputation. Is the best suction cup for the GoPros. The only bad thing i find about it is that you cannot fit it to small surfaces. You will need a smaller cup for this and GoPro will not have them available. I have attached this cup to a lot of cars running drag strip races on 1/4 mile and it has never failed me. Even on 9 second dragsters and no signs of trying to get loose.	2014-03-10	2006	There is really no need to talk much about a product with such a<br>reputation. Is the best suction cup for the GoPros.

R1NJFVIYDZFURH	5	It floats! (But doesn't fly)	In what shouldn't be a shock to anyone... the floaty back does indeed float.  It's also bright orange so you can see it floating in the water.<br /><br />The real reason I gave it 5-stars is that GoPro backs their stuff 100%.  I &#34;misused&#34; the floaty backdoor by attaching it (while attached to my GoPro) to a model rocket in hopes of getting some cool aerial shots.  Instead, the acceleration ripped the floaty from the 3M tape and sent my camera and rocket flying in 4 different directions.  It was like watching a 3rd world country doing rocket tests.  Anyway, I contacted GoPro and they sent me an entire new one for free.  That's quality.  Anyone can make a floating sponge with some industrial tape.  But it's the warranty they stand behind that makes this worth it.	2014-03-06	2010	In what shouldn't be a shock to anyone... the floaty back does<br>indeed float.

R50M5TMNTDJDN	5	If you use it right, this. thing. will. STICK!	After reading reviews on the Go Pro website I was wary of attaching this to my snowboard. Being on vacation, I said screw it, let's do this! I made sure to clean the cup and snowboard surface with a damp paper towel, dry it, and lock it down while the board and mount were indoors. I put it right before the front binding in the middle for a cool low-angle shot. After first exposing it to the cold for an hour or two, and then carving through thick, heavy powder amidst jumps and hard landings for at least 2 hours with it on, it DID NOT BUDGE. I plan to try the same approach on the outside of my car when it gets warmer out - will update if performance is less than exceptional.	2014-02-28	2016	After reading reviews on the Go Pro website I was wary of<br>attaching this to my snowboard.

R2MDG0V67ASQIJ	5	Really does hold	I was nervous about this truly holding tight to the side of my car.  But even after some big potholes at highway speeds, it was still exactly where I mounted it.  No movement, much less detachment.  Just be sure to clean the surface thoroughly before attaching.  Also, I like to use saliva to moisten it before attaching (i.e., lick the suction cup).  Using plain water will allow it to slip, where the starch in human saliva acts as a better seal.	2014-02-16	2028	I was nervous about this truly holding tight to the side of my<br>car.

R2R60SUA6Z24O5	4	Excellent Product	I used it in Panama and it functioned extremely well.  The little clip that holds the housing at the top pops off occasionally if you don't pull the band tight enough, which is annoying.  That's the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.

RHQSPISK7BS9T	4	Amazing suction... should have been metal	This 1st-party suction mount has an incredible grip.  I'm a 180lb. athletic build guy and I couldn't pull it off my granite countertop while it was engaged. Having said that, the plastic arm that supports the camera would have given out if I put my full body force behind it.  I'm confident that you can attach this to a car and go sailing through the mud (my Tacoma TRD &#34;Roxanne&#34; and I will be testing this out next weekend in low-country) without losing it.<br /><br />I'm a touch disappointed that it wasn't made of some kind of sturdy metal like reinforced aluminum or even nylon wrapped resin.  This is just plain old HDPE plastic.  However, it's GoPro, and they stand behind their stuff, so if you have an issue with it, they will jump at the chance to make it right.<br /><br />Minus 1 star for the support arm build materials.	2014-02-08	2036	This 1st-party suction mount has an incredible grip.

R20TQJKMFERFLQ	5	Stood up to every test thus far!	Great product, there are a number of different mounting pieces that help this product orient in various ways (side mount, front mount, top mount, etc.)  I've used it a number of times mounted to the exterior of my truck in rain and in snow and it hasn't budge once... and that was with a fair amount of speed and movement.<br /><br />The suction seal is very strong.  There is a button on the top that you depress to 'extend' the suction cup.  Once you press firmly down on the surface, there is a lever that you push down to really increase the suction.  It's darn near impossible to move or pull off once it's firmly attached.  Releasing is easy, just pull up the lever and separate the suction cup.  Leaves absolutely no marks or scratches on the car.<br /><br />Mine came with a small carry bag which is very helpful as there are a number of additional attachments for this mount.<br /><br />Highly recommended and worth the price paid.	2014-01-30	2045	Great product, there are a number of different mounting pieces<br>that help this product orient in various ways (side mount, front<br>mount, top mount, etc.)  I've used it a number of times mounted<br>to the exterior of my truck in rain and in snow and it hasn't<br>budge once... and that was with a fair amount of speed and<br>movement.<br /><br />The suction seal is very strong.

I do feel<br />confident enough that it can withstand a lot of abuse for it's intended<br />purposes.<br /><br />If you ever want to mount your gp to a tripod, I would highly suggest<br />this mounting accessory.	2014-01-30	2045	Received this item and I haven't put it through the field for<br>testing,<br />but I've come to appreciate its versatility with<br>both my tripods.

RTWSC262W192U	5	GoPro Roll Bar Mount	What can I say ... the item is exactly as described; it arrived quickly and I have no complaints. If you are new to GoPro and all of the accessories, I would recommend that you check out YouTube and search for the user MicBergsma. He has hundreds of videos on using the camera and all of the accessories. If you want to see the one for the GoPro Roll Bar Mount, just search for video: ezlGXZTarmE  Anyway, as for my purchase ... it arrived quickly and I would recommend it.	2014-01-30	2045	What can I say ... the item is exactly as described; it arrived<br>quickly and I have no complaints.

R1B5J4KKL7Z4OD	5	love it	The tripod mounts are a must have and now that it comes in a two pack its a much better deal. The block tripod adapter is great for quick change outs and utilizes GoPro short or tall mounts and actually has two areas underneath to mount it. If you're an avid GoPro user I'd say this is a must!<br />The Company was just as awesome and hassle free as the product, quick shipping and great price, thank you.	2014-01-30	2045	The tripod mounts are a must have and now that it comes in a two<br>pack its a much better deal.

R1K6CKUDDMOZWO	5	GoPro Headstrap	The headstrap is very sturdy and easy to adjust.

I was linked to GoPro's site after someone recommended this to me, and my first thought was to come to Amazon and look for it as I'm a Prime member. Well, it's $19.99 on GoPro's site, and $32.29 here from companies fulfilled by Amazon, or $19.99 from Amazon themselves except apparently it isn't stocked and has a 1 to 2 month shipping lead time. Just an FYI, pay attention to the sources. In this case avoid the obvious markups and just go get it from GoPro until Amazon can stock these things(or quit fulfilling unethical third parties).	2014-01-21	2054	*Edit* It seems Amazon has fixed the price on this item to match<br>GoPro's price(where this is fulfilled from).<br /><br />I<br>generally get everything from Amazon.

R3U8O1PVR1N3V6	4	Great suction cup for your gro pro	I tested out this section cup device on my BMW M3 and test at speeds in excess of hundred miles an hour. I had no issues with the product and I felt that it was solid and performed well. The only issue I have is that the product did not come with any type of instructions as it took me some time to figure out how to make the compression of the suction cup secure. Otherwise it would've given this five stars  I believe GoPro should put in some type of basic instructions so that people don't put their $500 camera outside the car as I can see some people making a mistake on how to use this product	2014-01-11	2064	I tested out this section cup device on my BMW M3 and test at<br>speeds in excess of hundred miles an hour.

R3KFPWXKDOJCK2	4	Another home run for Go Pro Charger	I love the finish on this charger.  It has a matte finish that almost feels velvety.  The real advantage to this charger is the dual USB ports and interchangeable international plugs ( a must if you travel abroad).  Frankly speaking, if you own an Apple product, their charger will work fine too.  I think this item is too expensive for what you are getting.  However, like other proprietary products, the goal is to brand their name and entice buyer to stick with the brand despite exorbitant prices.	2014-01-11	2064	I love the finish on this charger.

RYUHNHTSLEVV6	5	Good value	I purchased this mount so that I could modify the attachment to my ski helmet after upgrading to a GoPro Hero3.  I had constructed a mount for my old, fairly small Sony video camera so I could film my buddies while skiing.  Was not comfortable with the stick on mount that came with the GoPro, worrying that it might come off of the helmet, especially in cold temperatures.  This tripod mount was exactly what I needed to make a secure connection to my helmet, with no fear of it coming off, since it is essentially bolted to my helmet.  With this mount, I have much greater adjustability and the comfort in knowing that my camera will not fly off while screaming down the mountain.  Now if it will only snow.	2014-01-08	2067	I purchased this mount so that I could modify the attachment to<br>my ski helmet after upgrading to a GoPro Hero3.

R1O4LA7ML8FG1	5	These really 'Suck'! (In a good way)	I own 3 of these for my 3 GoPros. I attach them to my vintage Porsche 911 via the suction cup mounts.

It won't harm paint, but removes dirt, grease, and wax. (re-wax when finished) My only 'gripe' and it's minor, is the instructions are not so great. In a nutshell, release locking lever, push center of cup onto whatever you're attaching to, then move locking lever into place. It should be a little difficult to lock. If not, you haven't got it right. Once locked, wiggle it hard. It should be rock solid. Attach your GP, and have fun!

R1RH1LZOIAKNK9	5	Don't Leave Home Without Them	I have 4 GoPro cameras for professional use. Two original Hero HDs and two Hero 2s with WiFi. All have the flat lens dive housings so that whether I'm filming underwater or topside on terrafirma I won't have an issue with sharp focus if they are used in the water. All my waterproof cases have two of these inserts and I rotate fresh ones for each day's filming. The desiccant embedded in the paper has a very limited capacity for moisture absorption so I regenerate these often. Last thing you want to do is get that once in a lifetime money shot and have a foggy lens. Condensation can occur in the waterproof housing even on a hot sunny day so using these all the time is a wise decision.<br /><br />I don't bother with regenerating these in the oven. Mainly because if you have a gas-fired oven the combustion from the burner is creating moisture as a by-product which makes the process less efficient for drying the inserts. I use a 100-150 watt light bulb in one of those clamp-on reflectors pointed up towards the ceiling. I lay a loose piece of aluminum foil over the light reflector and then set the inserts and the included Humidity Monitor strip (the thing with the circle) on the foil. I'll let these heat and dry for a half hour and then seal them in a ziplock snack bag. If you have any of those small desiccant packages you find in packing materials for various products you can also regenerate that little package at the same time and put them inside the ziplock bag to help keep your inserts dry and fresh when you have to open the bag to swap out inserts. DO NOT place the USED inserts back in your baggie that contains DRY inserts.  I know that may seem obvious but.....<br /><br />Watch the Humidity Monitor card in your bag and when the color inside the circle turns PINK then you need to regenerate everything in the baggie, including the Monitor swatch. Just opening and closing the baggie puts moisture from the air in there and eventually the inserts lose their effectiveness.	2014-01-03	2072	I have 4 GoPro cameras for professional use. Two original Hero<br>HDs and two Hero 2s with WiFi. All have the flat lens dive<br>housings so that whether I'm filming underwater or topside on<br>terrafirma I won't have an issue with sharp focus if they are<br>used in the water. All my waterproof cases have two of these<br>inserts and I rotate fresh ones for each day's filming. The<br>desiccant embedded in the paper has a very limited capacity for<br>moisture absorption so I regenerate these often. Last thing you<br>want to do is get that once in a lifetime money shot and have a<br>foggy lens.

R1ZOP7FF8HGBA6	1	No directions.	Haven't had a chance to use it, but it's some industrial sized suction cup so it should hold just fine. It's just a pain to set up because there are pieces they send you along with the pieces you have from the camera itself. Too many pieces and there are NO DIRECTIONS that come with this item. You'll have to watch a tutorial on Youtube or something. Enjoy nonetheless.<br /><br />EDIT 9/1/13: This item SUCKS! It sticks to just about everything BESIDES MY CAR! The whole point is so I can use the application then just stick it to my car and record. Nope, went out for a test drive yesterday and had to hold the thing out the window. It stayed on my windshield, hood, car for about two minutes, and the fastest speed I could reach was 60mph before it came rolling off. My car was clean. Very clean, and it still did not stick to it. When I tried it on a mini-fridge we have outside in our garage, that's dirtier than my car, it stuck with no problem. So I tried a dirty part of my car, and the same problem happened. This item is defective and I can't even replace it because it's not available again until February 1st. So now I'll be receiving a refund for a defective item that had NO DIRECTIONS and I'm assuming DID NOT come with all its parts.	2013-12-31	2075	Haven't had a chance to use it, but it's some industrial sized<br>suction cup so it should hold just fine.

R3CWOD65ECSGC5	5	Great product; very useful!	I use these for underwater shooting, in &#60;40 deg F water temps and air temps and these work perfectly.  Prior to using the inserts, I started having severe fogging issues inside the sealed GoPro housing when temps started dropping into the low 60s.  These inserts do the trick and I use 3 at a time as recommended.  I've baked and re-used them time and again and they last through multiple openings of the housing to change batteries/memory cards in the camera.  The little humidity monitor car that comes with these is useless.  If I went by it's indicator areas, my inserts would never be &#34;active&#34; and would never work.  It's unnecessary and inaccurate.<br /><br />WORD OF CAUTION: Make sure that the way you position the inserts does NOT touch/interfere with the seal around the door; AT ALL.  If it does, adjust them until it doesn't, because the case WILL leak (albeit slowly) otherwise and you will have fog (or water, if it's bad).	2013-12-11	2095	I use these for underwater shooting, in &#60;40 deg F water<br>temps and air temps and these work perfectly.

R2B3PIPOIX27PV	4	Helpful	I got this for my Gopro hero 2.  It helps if you want to see what you are shooting.  Also great for viewing shots taken when no monitor is available.

R1T4H21OILIRJL	5	Excellent POV solution for GoPro cameras	Sure, you'll look like a dork with this strap on your head and the GoPro camera mounted on it... but you won't care about that when you see the great POV footage that you are able to capture, and when you realize that the headstrap mount is very durable and reliable.<br /><br />Adjustable to fit most anyone, the strap is very secure and will not let you lose or drop your valuable camera.  It is also easy to wear over a hat, which is my preferred way.  The adjustments to tilt the camera are excellent and make this mount truly valuable.  Perfect for situations when you want that POV footage and don't have another mounting solution available.  Folds down very compactly and is easy to keep with you at all times.<br /><br />The Quick-Clip is a great little idea, and it was the reason I bought this set. Its stated purpose is to attach to the lower rim of a cap, like a baseball cap worn backwards.  But it has many other possible uses, and increases the versatility of use for your GoPro camera.

R2ULQL5PAUNU9S	3	Didin't hold well rotation wise but fixed it	I like that it has a brass insert in the Polycarbonate plastic so that the threads won't strip out as easily over time.  Unfortunately, the brass insert in mine stuck up above the plastic so it didn't lock into place rotation-wise very well.  I wound up grinding the brass insert down to below the plastic base, being careful not to get the insert too hot so as to melt the plastic, and now it grips much better.	2013-11-24	2112	I like that it has a brass insert in the Polycarbonate plastic<br>so that the threads won't strip out as easily over time.<br>Unfortunately, the brass insert in mine stuck up above the<br>plastic so it didn't lock into place rotation-wise very well.

Not really meant for impact sports, but I have tried and it will work pretty good unless your head takes a direct hit, or the sudden impact shifts the camera.<br />Head Strap is fully adjustable to fit all size heads.<br />QuickClip allows you to attach your GoPro to a backwards baseball cap or any 3mm to 10mm thick object.<br />Get this and let the fun begin.	2013-11-11	2125	Nice upgrade from the previous model, no more screw and screw to<br>mount and un mount.

R3IGCDO2Z66X6X	3	50/50	I am split 50/50 on this product.  I used it on my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition and on some days it worked perfectly and on other days it  did not work.  Looked on Google and Youtube for help when inserting the fog inserts therefore I am sure that I put them in the best locations.  On one snorkling trip no fog which was great but on a walking trip to the beach and then some swimming caused it to fog.  Therefore it worked half the time even though new fog inserts were used.	2013-11-10	2126	I am split 50/50 on this product.

R3TAGXBHSC320	5	Needed for GoPro DYI projects	Not much to say quality OEM mounts for GoPro's.  These have the screw bottom (1/4in) so they screw on to a 1/4 thread bolt or stud.

R2TNZIGVN5A6EX	5	Better than the $5 stand alone tripod mount	This is better than the five dollar stand alone tripod mount. Why? Because it includes a quick release base, making it easier and quicker to mount/dismount the GoPro to/from your tripod, x-shot, monopod, or other non-GoPro support system. It's totally worth the extra five bucks, imho.<br /><br />If you want a smaller, sleeker setup, you can always use the smaller tripod mount that attaches directly to the GoPro. But it's nice have the quick release option as well.<br /><br />I usually keep the quick release base mounted on my [[ASIN:B004URTJ6U XShot XSP2 Pocket Camera Extender]], so it's as easy as snapping in my Hero3+ when I need it mounted.	2013-10-31	2136	This is better than the five dollar stand alone tripod mount.<br>Why?

R1KXMUVMX9OD74	3	Design leaves something to be desired	I like the mount itself but it can be very hard to get on and off without the camera on the front slapping around.

R3Q3YYA242WGSS	4	Handy, but not necessarily essential	The GoPro is known for being mounted anywhere, surviving anything, and thriving out in the field. It's surprising, however, how good it can be in a relatively traditional environment. That environment means tripod mounting. Because of the light weight of the GoPro, you really don't need a heavy duty tripod, but you will need this mount. I can see why GoPro didn't include it automatically, as mounting to a tripod is the furthest thing from the mind of many GoPro users, and with the bevy of mounting options, many GoPro users assume this mount would also be included. It is not.<br /><br />You really might not need this mount, but it's nice to have.<br /><br />It is missing some hardware, like some hex nuts, but you can get those from a local hardware store pretty cheap.<br /><br />My main grip is that it mounts to the underwater or skeleton case, which in and of itself is fine, but if you have this on a tripod, you'd also like to be able to do things like run the hdmi out, which the case that this tripod mount attaches to makes impossible--without some work-arounds.<br /><br />It is solid though, with the fit and finish you'd expect from GoPro, and though some are saying over-priced, is still relatively cheap.	2013-10-30	2137	The GoPro is known for being mounted anywhere, surviving<br>anything, and thriving out in the field.

Cheap enough to have more than one, and keep them handy!<br /><br />It works perfectly fine, as expected. My only wish is that GoPro would make a similar tripod mount that accepts the standard slide-in \\""foot\\"" of the GoPro housing, as most other mounts do.

R15LKWZU4SOZ9X	3	Purchased hoping for ability to swivel, but it doesn't	So I was in Cocoa Beach, Florida and wanted to get some shots while body boarding, and for that this worked. It does come with many back doors including one that will hold an orange floatation device in case camera comes free from wrist strap. I have to say that this is subject to a lot of wear and tear, with the salt water and the sand, plus the force of these things that end up against the housing. For this I think a better choice is to get a kayak or surf board rack. Regardless, this should be washed over and over with warm soapy water, and rinsed and dried before trying to access the camera inside.  The product I bought was from Best Buy in Orlando, not Amazon, and came with no information, and was difficult to open and free all the different pieces.<br /><br />I was hoping that the camera housing could be turned 90 degrees and point down my arm, so that while riding rides at the many theme parks would give me a good chance to capture the ride in whole, but this does not let you have it in any position other than how a watch sits on its band. Your arm has to be held up and video shot sideways. This was a big disappointment, considering the cost and how many hook and loop attachments to secure the camera on the wrist strap.<br /><br />The only way to capture pictures through the parks are to mount this on an extension and hold it with your hand. That or use a helmet or head mount, and the parks frown on use of any video during the rides.<br /><br />To sum it up, I would have returned this had I not had to tear apart the plastic that wrapped this up and the piece between all of the wrist mounts. really $40 that could been spent on better accessories. Love the camera, but their are better attachments, for most applications.	2013-09-03	2194	So I was in Cocoa Beach, Florida and wanted to get some shots<br>while body boarding, and for that this worked.

The fact that I had to buy this separately and for $8 was a sore point for me, but I needed to mount the GoPro on a tripod-type of mount (for a suction cup mount).	2013-09-01	2196	Really.

R37UTM72BAD348	5	Mount that every GoPro owner should have	Does exactly what it is supposed to do.

RMHTN150HFFGX	5	Perfect fit!!	Looked a little confusing coming out of the package, but very simple once you look at it.

R2VDPAOKSUHPSE	4	a must have for any GoPro camera!	GoPro really should put this in all their versions but they don't!

R1G78BUN0X9ARF	4	Perfect charger for GOPro Hero 3	This is what go pro users need to have. The batteries on the camera and remote control don't hold the charge for long periods of time.

R2AKJVLCA2TUCN	4	Good unit	Not sure why they don't include the bolt with the nut but you only get the nut shown in the picture--no bolt attached.  This is essential when using a camera stick.  Only other recommendation would be to add a felt or rubber washer or surface where it screws on to prevent wobble and make a tighter fit but I guess most tripods have that part.  Seems solid and reliable.  If you have a GoPro then you need one of these!.	2013-08-23	2205	Not sure why they don't include the bolt with the nut but you<br>only get the nut shown in the picture--no bolt attached.

R3L9XWCNDXZNLV	3	Decent quality, does the job, wish it came with a screw/ nut	Seems made of high impact plastic like most GoPro OEM parts. It does the job, but for this price should come with a screw/ nut.<br /><br />GoPro is an icon for making you pay for every tiny little add-on that you will absolutely need. The fact that the tripod mount comes with no nut (for attaching the standard camera casing) puts the tactic on a whole new galactic level. Especially for this price. Now I need to go buy a nut?

R3MGG0V8EX846L	4	Another expensive piece of GoPro plastic	This is probably one of the more versatile GoPro mounts.

RAEY1VXH866E	4	Works, but the nut falls out	This mount doesn't come with a thumb screw, but it does it's job just fine. I'm giving 4 starts only because the nut easily falls out when removing the GoPro from this mount.

RCYN20G9DFKZ8	5	GoPro Roll Bar Mount	This is a great accessory for your GoPro, you can almost clamp it to anything and it will fit securely and you don't have to worry about it coming off.

RWN9BRYLK59BN	4	Its a mount..	That's pretty much it, for around $8 you get a little plastic thing to connect it to a tripod mount. Not much to it, wish it was a bit cheaper or came included (or at least on the black edition) though.	2013-07-26	2233	That's pretty much it, for around $8 you get a little plastic<br>thing to connect it to a tripod mount.

RGT2L0OBSODLT	4	Works, but simple too	I used this for my monopod. While there is a smaller telescoping small camera device for taking &#34;self-portraits&#34; they are limited to 37 inches. If you used a GoPro, you know there is a distortion factor that close (depends on settings) so using Monopod seems to be the answer. Also great to use for making your own mounts since it can take a 1/4-20 bolt.	2013-07-25	2234	I used this for my monopod.

R1O9TWQJ6SUB9F	5	This is a must have!	I purchased this product because I am on vacation in Hawaii, and unfortunately I had to purchase it from a camera store instead of Amazon. With that said I still would like to share my opinions on the product to help anyone who is unsure if this is a good product for them.<br /><br />Why would you need this product? If you have ever owned a underwater camera which gets foggy (this is what happened to me) then it will work great for you. Basically, what happens: Your Go Pro can get hot while the weather outside is still cold. This creates a little fog on the lens causing fog or condensation which can ruin your video and photos.<br /><br />I had my camera sitting in the Hawaiian sun for hours then jumped in to a 65 degree cold fresh water spring. Typically this would cause fog on the inside of the case, but luckily the inserts were inside and prevented this from happening.<br /><br />All in all for the price you are better safe than sorry by using this product with your Go Pro!<br /><br />As a side note: I use this in both my Hero 3 and Hero 1 cases and it works. Just because it is a hero 3 insert doesn't mean you only have to use it for that camera.<br /><br />Also, an important note. You can use these multiple times you just put them in the oven for 5 minutes at 300 degrees to dry them out. So dont think you can only use them once! Make sure to get your moneys worth!!!<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this product and would definitely purchase it again.	2013-07-22	2237	I purchased this product because I am on vacation in Hawaii, and<br>unfortunately I had to purchase it from a camera store instead<br>of Amazon.

RDIIMZ67CKFUX	5	LOVE HAVING IT--IF WANT TO USE...	There's always something each of us can gripe about--but all in all, this is a doggone good buy.  The camera is perfect for its intended use... and this adds a real nice feature.  Some might argue it should have come with the camera in the first place... but either way, it being separate and detachable is a big plus for what this is.  Good deal.	2013-06-15	2274	There's always something each of us can gripe about--but all in<br>all, this is a doggone good buy.

R29CQVVRHQUU9Y	5	Indispensible	Just get one for your GoPro. It's too bad GoPro doesn't put a brass threaded insert in all their standard flat bases or just provide one of these with the standard accessories.

R364P3T0T8DWHC	4	Useful	I bought this mount to use my hero 3 on my bicycle and it does well enough. The mail clamp is large enough to fit most round surfaces larger than about .75 inches. The main clamp holds securely to its point of attachment. I like that it  comes with the assortment of connecting arms to enable users to put the clams just about anywhere and still have the camera point the right direction.<br />  My only real complaint is that the joints don't resist vibrations all that well. The camera has a tendency to follow its center of gravity and tilt in unwanted directions if there is much vibration felt thought the mount. This is for the simple fact that the joints are smooth plastic and not knurled mating surfaces. The up side is that the smooth plastic gives you unlimited adjustment versus having fixed increments so you can get the exact angle you want.<br />  In all, I would buy it again.	2013-05-15	2305	I bought this mount to use my hero 3 on my bicycle and it does<br>well enough.

RX9WDY89B7P2H	5	Great Item	This is so cool, I wore them three times when I hunted wild hogs from a helicopter; great video! They were so awesome, I bought one. And I bought extra batteries, 64gb Mini SD cards, Car charger, video back so I can view them anywhere straight from the GOPRO Hero3, and a pelican case to haul the thing around. I also bought a picatinny rail mount so I can video POV from my rifle or shotgun. The only downside is the size of the files it creates, a nice 1 hour movie is 4-8 GB, way to big to upload most places or email to a friend.	2013-04-13	2337	This is so cool, I wore them three times when I hunted wild hogs<br>from a helicopter; great video!

RAHAI11B7F85U	3	Does the job at the right price but...	This was a really good price.  It makes it easy to mount your GoPro on a monopod.  I bought a Targus alloy monopod for snorkeling in Hawaii and I had to get a tripod mount to make it all work well.  I got all sorts of ooos, aahhs, and compliments on my setup.  I also slung the monopod over my shoulder when hiking and set it up for a timelapse.<br /><br />Another eye catching setup that drew a lot of attention.  Later  in the day when kids saw me, they were saying &#34;Hey, you're the guy with the GoPro.  This made for some really awesome self portraits and timelapses during a whole week in Hawaii.  The only reason I don't give this nifty little accessory 5 stars is because it has started to rust a bit or at show signs of rust where the tripod/monopod screws in.  Since these are underwater capable camera housings and that's part of the expected use... it seems like this should be a stainless steel screwhole that will stay clear of any rust forever.  That's a major lack of design foresight in my opinion.  But the price on this is so good through Amazon, it's worth it and you can just buy a new one every 6 months or so if the rust becomes a problem.  But if it does&#60; I might just suggest springing for an upgraded one that's stainless steel.  Because these are super handy accessories that can help you reach a higher level with your videos as long as you use a good monopod or decent tripod with this mount.	2013-03-19	2362	This was a really good price.

Since these are underwater capable<br>camera housings and that's part of the expected use... it seems<br>like this should be a stainless steel screwhole that will stay<br>clear of any rust forever.  That's a major lack of design<br>foresight in my opinion.  But the price on this is so good<br>through Amazon, it's worth it and you can just buy a new one<br>every 6 months or so if the rust becomes a problem.  But if it<br>does&#60; I might just suggest springing for an upgraded one<br>that's stainless steel.  Because these are super handy<br>accessories that can help you reach a higher level with your<br>videos as long as you use a good monopod or decent tripod with<br>this mount.
R268UAS0EWWVDF	4	Beware of loose acorn nut (but still buy it)	Let's face it. When it comes to certain GoPro accessories you're pretty much stuck paying whatever they ask.  Is this little piece of plastic the size of the end of my thumb worth $5.80? No, but it works (and it's cheaper than the knock off brand).  Beware of the acorn nut coming loose though.  This can be an issue with certain GoPro mounts.	2013-03-19	2362	Let's face it. When it comes to certain GoPro accessories you're<br>pretty much stuck paying whatever they ask.

R2LI71X6OHAEVS	4	The missing link	My Hero didn't come with a standard mount for attachment to tripods, something I would have thought would be a natural inclusion. But this little guy fills that void. As with my reviews for other plastic camera mounts, I think it could have been sold more cheaply, but it's not outrageous or anything and pretty handy to have. It basically attaches the GoPro protective case to a standard threaded tripod mount.	2013-03-12	2369	My Hero didn't come with a standard mount for attachment to<br>tripods, something I would have thought would be a natural<br>inclusion.

R32SJD4NV116HS	4	Same problem as all GoPro mounts, but allows the use of normal tripod mounts	GoPro Tripod Adapter<br /><br />The GoPro fingered mounts have a major flaw and that is it cannot be tightened properly. Over-tightening the thumbscrew does not resolve the issue. Instead, friction must be applied in between the fingers. I found scope rosin (powdered rosin) that is used for scope rings worked great. Just a dab on each surface and I no longer have to over tighten the thumb screw. However, the GoPro mounts are weak and can/will crack with enough force. At least with this adapter it can allow you to use a variety of tripods or mounts.<br /><br />The adapter comes with the stainless acorn nut but requires re-using a thumbscrew.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars	2013-03-11	2370	GoPro Tripod Adapter<br /><br />The GoPro fingered mounts have a<br>major flaw and that is it cannot be tightened properly.

This function allows you to capture a series of pictures in predefined time intervals.<br />In practice, you set up your camera in a place where you know that it will capture the action, press the button and just leave it there and forget about it until the action is over.<br />I also use this accesory with a T200L extendable self-shot monopod.<br />But the most important situation where this accesory comes in handy is taking pictures in low-light situations with your GoPro.<br />These cameras take good pictures during the day but need to be completely still in order to take good pictures in low-light situations (that is, using the standard camera settings).<br />Finally, if you want to use standard accesories that use the screw that goes into the bottom hole of most cameras, this is the gadget that you need to interface between them and your GoPro camera.	2013-02-09	2400	Some people might say that this is an unnecesary item for your<br>action-camera (I use a GoPro Hero3), since these types of<br>cameras are expected to be used in &#34;action&#34;<br>situations.<br />I beg to disagree.

RFUM8LZ0XCHGW	4	Great Product	While there's not much to it, this mount was exactly what I needed. I decided to build my own handheld mount for my GoPro using this and a two-liter bottle blank. It made for much easier handling of the camera and it floats. My only complaint is that the bottom of the mount where the 1/4&#34;-20 thread is located is slightly convex as opposed to being flat. It doesn't provide as good a point of contact and allows for some movement when the camera is mounted.	2013-01-28	2412	While there's not much to it, this mount was exactly what I<br>needed.

R1WUVMOLM93Y8S	5	Brings a whole new world of features to the GoPro	I absolutely love my GoPro and I love my GoPro accessories, and if you are going to buy one accessory for your GoPro, this is it. The screen gives you full menu access instead of using the tiny lcd on the front and gives you the ability to see what you are shooting as well as reviewing what you just shot.<br /><br />Battery life drops if you leave it on, but what do you expect from adding a screen!<br /><br />Best GoPro accessory yet. Would buy again.	2012-11-28	2473	I absolutely love my GoPro and I love my GoPro accessories, and<br>if you are going to buy one accessory for your GoPro, this is<br>it.

R2O0827IJ8YZL	2	Default purchase	I bought this because GoPro was so incredibly lame in continually delaying the release of the software to view the GoPro image off device.  That is a whole issue in itself about how not to  run a consumer company.<br /><br />This does what it is supposed to... you can see the image.  Too small.  Totally inconvenient that this takes the place of the remote control / battery pac / whatever.  It was a little bit better than having nothing.<br /><br />Given that the software is now available, then I would not recommend this to anyone.	2012-11-19	2482	I bought this because GoPro was so incredibly lame in<br>continually delaying the release of the software to view the<br>GoPro image off device.

I got to where I would leave the camera on, but turn off the Bacpac until I was going to take a video.  It is easy to turn the Bacpac on and off while the video is going.  I was able to save battery juice this way.  I got around an hour 45 to 2-hours out of a single charge.  The firmware upgrade was a pain in the butt to download, but finally got it to take.	2012-10-24	2508	I like that you can see what you are shooting.  It came in great<br>while diving.

R2XOT4R8AOTT6A	5	Great for tripod use	The fact that the GoPro kit doesnt come with this standard amazes me. Sometimes you just want to mount the camera to a tripod or maybe a custom gimbal like I had planned to do. I ended up using this to mount the camera to a zip-line style gimbal that would allow nice smooth moving shots. Works well and I havent had any issues with it.	2012-08-27	2566	The fact that the GoPro kit doesnt come with this standard<br>amazes me.

Mine died a few weeks after getting it & I was sorely disappointed.  I thought the vibration &/or heat from the race car killed the screen.

RDZZIR65EBDK1	4	LCD Stopped working - How to Fix	"The LCD BacPac is great and would worth the price, as long as it works.    I bought one and after a few uses the LCD would not turn on.  I was not using the camera or lcd where there is any impact or much vibration in the camera, nor am I using it underwater, but I always used the protective case.  I got a new one.  It stopped working after a few light uses as well.    After some trial and error and the firmware update not working the first time, I figured out how to get it to work again.    First, if you have not updated the firmware...  1. Update the firmware: [...]  Make sure your camera is HD HERO2:  a. Off  b. Disconnected from the computer  c. With the SD card inserted  d. With the battery fully charged  2a) Once successfully installed, close the program \\""CineForm Studio\\""  3a) Turn on your camera HD HERO2  4a) If your camera or your SD card has not been used before, make a small photo or video.  5a) Connect your camera to your HD HERO2 computer with a USB cable.  6a) Open the \\""CineForm Studio\\"".  7a) If an update is available, a dialog box will appear - click \\""Update\\"" (Update).  8a) The \\""CineForm Studio\\"" that update automatically download and install it on your camera HERO2 HD camera.    After updating the firmware...  2. With the LCD BacPac not attached to the camera, turn the camera power on.  3. Press and hold the LCD power button (the only button on the LCD BacPac.  4. While holding down the button on the LCD BacPac, attach the BacPac to the Camera. (LCD should start working with a menu screen, but the camera may not want to respond to button commands - mine didn't)  5. Turn the camera off (with LCD attached)  6. Turn the camera back on (with LCD attached).    Camera and LCD should now work as is supposed to.    If this wasn't so difficult and had to search forever to find out the final trick (of attaching the LCD with the button pushed and the camera on, I would have given it 5 stars.  As it is, I was tempted to give it 3.  GoPro does not provide the directions for attaching the LCD after an update."	2012-08-16	2577	"The LCD BacPac is great and would worth the price, as long as it<br>works.

R1MJ02ZQL2XJ7B	5	Exactly what I needed, and cheap!	Sometimes accessories like this should be included but aren't and you get annoyed - but, other times they are really cheap and it's ok.  $7 is reasonable for this.

Well made, not cheap feeling, and less than $10, can't complain.	2012-08-15	2578	Sometimes accessories like this should be included but aren't<br>and you get annoyed - but, other times they are really cheap and<br>it's ok.  $7 is reasonable for this.

The LCD is clear and sharp enough to help you frame your video.  The playback to see what you captured is a lot of fun and helps yo make adjustments for the next attempt.

R2KUVZGN9RFP13	3	Is what it is.	The LCD Bacpac does what it says it will. The screen is not great but adequate for framing shots or reviewing footage. It is a bit of a power hog even at is lowest settings. Honestly its been less useful than I thought it would be before I purchased it. I can line up most shots just by eyeballing and the battery Bacpac which cant be used in conjunction with the LCD is definitely more important to me. Lastly, this is none item that Amazon does not have the best price on. In my experience that doesn't happen often.	2012-07-09	2615	The LCD Bacpac does what it says it will.

You can charge 2 batteries at once - still need the camera or the extra battery backpack - in a controlled space and its not eating up your laptop battery or USB ports any more.  It comes with the cable so there is no reason to buy more if you've misplaced the one that came with the camera.  This device does the job and in true GoPro style does so at a price point that doesn't absolutely kill your wallet.  There are probably other, cheaper, ways to charge your batteries, but this one certainly does the job for me.	2012-06-06	2648	I used to charge batteries on my GoPro Hero by plugging it into<br>my MacBook Pro and waiting for the red light to turn off.

The OSD is basically the same info you get from the stock GoPro text only menus. The only real functionality you get is being able to preview your video/picture when the LCD is in view, If you're mounting the camera somewhere (aka most of the time) the usefulness goes away rather fast.  For the price and the need to satiate my desire for an LCD screen, i'd buy it again.	2012-06-03	2651	I bought this because a camera needs an LCD display right? Not<br>really.

Messed with it for like 2-3 hrs and read bunch of stuff online still nothing!!! 2 days passed by and I gave it another try and finally when I connected my camera to computer, the update thingy came up and i was able to get the 7.0 and now it works!!!! But def not a good way to start with brand new product, I understand the lcd wasn't available before but still now being able to update and finally some how after 2 days able to update!! But over all love the thing!! Only thing not happy still is the underwater problem, that I need to fix before I head to south east asia!!! so make sure once you get the LCD, update your camera first!!! if you don't it will probably work for a little then stop and only hear the beeping!!!

R3CUMYPH1GKH14	3	Flexes and easily broken	"It is plastic but they have lasted for a little while.  I've had some that just don't last out of 4 cameras.  In hard wrecks (circle track racing) sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  What I have had is on the longer extension arm it breaks right at the ears.  If you tighten them down too much they do flex, if not, then they can tend to move and lose the \\""shot\\"" that you had to set up.  The roll bar mount needs to be tightened pretty well to get it to stay and the rubber pieces have slipped a little but are still stuck to it.  When you tighten the roll bar mount around the bar it will start to flex and bend together.  It would be nice if they made a \\""teeth\\"" version of the pieces so when you tighten the teeth lock it down.  At this time I am looking into other mounts that are more professional and heavier duty."	2012-05-04	2681	"It is plastic but they have lasted for a little while.

R36H4RL9C9IGBP	4	useful & fun - but keep in mind battery life if you're in remote locations	Works well, but keep in mind that you won't be able to see much in the LCD screen in sunlight.<br />It helps mostly when you start to use the camera and are not yet familiar with the different wide-narrow video modes. Also useful for timelapses.<br /><br />It eats on the battery as expected, but as I have it to automatically turn off after a minute, it wasn't that bad.<br /><br />Only detail is that I saw somewhere on the GoPro reviews that it would transform significantly the menu and how you go around the camera settings.

R2JOKZDYH5XRV	5	Handy Product to Have	"This product is a must have for the GoPro Heros.  It allows you to frame your shot, instead of just \\""guessing\\"" what you're shooting.  The BacPac also comes with 4 additional cage backs to fit on your current housing.<br /><br />That being said this product is not perfect.  It drains the battery fast, so you have to use it sparingly if you don't have extra Hero batteries.<br /><br />Like others have posted, I was also a victim of this product only working for a day before I got the black screen of death.  The LCD worked perfectly the first day I used it.  The second day I could not get the screen to turn on.  I then updated the firmware in my Hero2 and it still did not work.  I emailed GoPro and they emailed me the solution in under 24 hours.  The trick that I did not know was that by holding down the LCD BacPac's button while attaching to the Hero2 (already powered on) and holding the button for 5 seconds after attaching it.  This got the LCD pac working for me again.  Since then I have had no issues with it.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this product, especially when you compare it to a video monitor with HDMI input.

R1DWUQXW2EYQE5	4	Overall pretty good, but one major annoyance so far	The screen works very well in just about every respect.  The only real problem I have had so far, however, is pretty annoying.  Several times when trying to play back a video on the LCD backpack attempting to adjust the volume level (which always defaults to minimum) caused the entire GoPro HD Hero2 to freeze up.  I waited 5-10 minutes on one of these to see if it would ever respond and it did not.  No amount of button pressing (long or short) would get a response.  Both times I ultimately had to pull the camera apart and yank the battery.  This is rather unacceptable to me.<br /><br />As I said, aside from that one flaw the unit functions wonderfully so I am still rating it at 4 stars.  I imagine a simple firmware update would fix the problem if they ever get around to it.	2012-03-08	2738	The screen works very well in just about every respect.

This is rather<br>unacceptable to me.<br /><br />As I said, aside from that one<br>flaw the unit functions wonderfully so I am still rating it at 4<br>stars.  I imagine a simple firmware update would fix the problem<br>if they ever get around to it.

R3I91WOUTVD2CE	4	Expensive for my use, but very functional	There have been a lot of reviews already written about this, but I felt I needed to add my input about my usage.  I currently have 4 GoPro cameras, including the 3D setup.  My main desire with the screen is for help in aiming the cameras appropriately to make better use of the footage I take.  I use my camera mainly for motorcycle track days and racing.  I see almost every weekend I am at the track people having the GoPro pointing too high or too low, and I can only imagine what their footage will look like when they return home.  My concern on the day isn't for looking at footage for review, it's simply to check the angle of the camera mounting then remove and use only the camera itself.  The battery usage is higher than I would like, which is why I don't run this on the camera, or use it to review footage.  Most days I don't have time while at the track to review the footage, and because of the screen size, I would rather review the footage on a laptop or at home on a larger monitor.  I suppose if you had something that you wanted to show someone, for example, a line around the race track, close accident, etc, it would come in handy, but the small size of the screen doesn't demonstrate it well.  Here is my setup.  I put the camera on the bike with the door open and the LCD attached.  I adjust the angle to get the perfect setup with the wide angle lens, then I remove the camera leaving the case still on the motorcycle, remove the LCD screen, put the camera in the case and close it.  This gives me the perfect angle for each camera setup.  The LCD screen then goes back in storage until I need it again if I change angles, or for the next days.  This keeps me from recording mostly sky or ground because of a wrong angle, and that itself is worth the money, but for $80 I don't know if that is worth it to everyone else if you plan to use it like I do.  If you plan to use it to review footage constantly, bring a charger and an extra battery, as it does compromise the battery life for recording.	2012-02-21	2754	There have been a lot of reviews already written about this, but<br>I felt I needed to add my input about my usage.

R2A21XJID0LWQS	1	Worked great - once.	We bought this on the same day as the rest of the Hero 2 rig for our trip to the Caymans. I loved it out of the box - super easy set up - just snap it on and off you go. It worked as promised for one day. The next morning - black screen of death. I updated the firmware, tried everything else I could think of (and I operate cameras for a living), but no love. And we had six more days of diving and boating to shoot! What a waste. We'll see how responsive the warranty department is.	2012-02-19	2756	We bought this on the same day as the rest of the Hero 2 rig for<br>our trip to the Caymans.

R26IWK4P36GT8L	5	see what you record	This is a very cool feature, kinda wish it was stock on the GoPro. It makes the unit a little bulky and a few of the knob conflict with the larger case backing. But aside from that I found it to be very helpful when no pc is around to view your footage, It's also easy to swap backings out quiet quickly. example: maybe record with the no LCD backing, than attach the LCD back and review your footage. That seems  to work pretty well for me.	2012-02-03	2772	This is a very cool feature, kinda wish it was stock on the<br>GoPro.

RV39H2J4I5I1Y	5	Works very well	I read some reviews before I purchased this that it does not come with a nut. Mine did come with one, so if that happens to you I would imagine Gopro would be happy to send the nut to you, or accept a return/exchange.  As for function, this makes it so you can put your Gopro easily on a tripod. Not too difficult a conversion, and the task is performed adequately without an abundance of extra material to weigh things down. Pretty simple to use, just pull out the pin from your housing mount, slide the two posts in the bottom, put the pin back in through all the lined up holes, twist to tighten and you are in business.  I got it to put on a monopod so I could put it down in the water, virtually hands free. The swell has been a bit big to try it in some tide pools, but it has worked great for chasing fish around my aquarium. It also is nice for getting shots of the cat without being on the ground. All you do is flip the Gopro setting to upside down and thread on and you are in business.  So, in conclusion I am happy with this purchase, and will recommend to friends who Gopro.	2012-02-01	2774	I read some reviews before I purchased this that it does not<br>come with a nut.

R1RAXPM9TZ72AW	2	Frequently defective	"There seems to be a very high number of these being returned for a \\""Black Screen of Death\\"" problem where the screen suddenly stops displaying the video feed although the button on the LCD itself can still be used to put the camera into review mode showing that the BacPac still interacts fine with the camera. To get this problem fixed, you have to send them your already exorbitantly overpriced LCD *and* camera *at your expense* regardless if your camera works fine or not. I gave it 2 stars because there are a few things it does nicely (when it works) such as setting up angles for stationary shots and it also displays the menu items in full words rather than force you to decipher the cryptic letters on the camera display. The biggest thing is being able to review a video immediately after filming. The extra weight from the BacPac might make your camera a little more likely to flop around in high-impact environments. Overall, I would not recommend buying this item because it is overpriced, and GoPro is handling the defective units poorly by making the customer pay even more money to have it repaired for such a frequent problem. Reviewing videos on scene is nice, but not *that* nice. Wait until a new model with better quality manufacturing arrives."	2012-01-30	2776	"There seems to be a very high number of these being returned for<br>a \\""Black Screen of Death\\"" problem where the screen suddenly<br>stops displaying the video feed although the button on the LCD<br>itself can still be used to put the camera into review mode<br>showing that the BacPac still interacts fine with the camera.

R26CL8BTZ7T9KU	5	This one comes prepared!	One of the things I hate most about buying accessories is that a person normally has to buy other accessories to make the original accessory work.  With the LCD Bacpac this is not the case.  Thank you, GoPro, for including FOUR different case covers.  Someone had the genius idea (not sarcasm) and foresight to realize that two different cases in both sealed and ventilated forms would require different doors with this product.  So, not only can you see what you're shooting in advance, but right out of the box you're ready to dive, bike or do whatever you use your GoPro for.  My hats off to you, GoPro.	2012-01-26	2780	One of the things I hate most about buying accessories is that a<br>person normally has to buy other accessories to make the<br>original accessory work.

R7S3AK51UQNG8	5	Great little accessory	I purchased the LCD Bacpac along with a Gopro hd hero 1. Yes, it's an additional $70 you have to spend but with the hd hero already being a good deal, I thought it was worth it. The LCD bacpac has worked flawlessly since last August. I have used this underwater, on cars, on rc cars, around the house and love being able to frame the shots instead of just hoping my camera placement is correct.  The LCD is easy to view in most conditions. Direct sunlight will make it tougher to see, but that's expected from most LCD's.  *Notes  I believe you have to update the camera firmware before attaching the LCD bacpac. I followed the instructions and never had any trouble with it.  Be sure to set the LCD to shut off after 60 seconds (in settings) and your battery will last much longer.	2012-01-17	2789	I purchased the LCD Bacpac along with a Gopro hd hero 1.

R37WEXOQQOKDHA	5	Must-have accessory for your GoPro	I love my GoPro HD but really hated the abbreviated text for the modes and the possibility of missing a shot (and not finding out til afterwards!).<br /><br />The LCD Bacpac comes with additional doors for the clear GoPro case since the LCD Bacpac obviously adds extra girth to the GoPro.<br /><br />After clipping it on and attaching the new doors to your GoPro's clear case, you're ready to go.  All the controls work the same, but now you have immediate visual feedback.  It really makes the GoPro much easier to use and never have that fear of missing a precious shot.<br /><br />It works very well in daylight (awesome indoors, ok outside) but while underwater, (in daylight) I sometimes had to rely on the front red light since the reflection within (or without?) the case while under the water made it difficult to tell where I was aiming.<br /><br />I know they wanted to keep costs down (by not including a screen), but to me, this is an essential accessory for the GoPro and really makes it a much more useful all-season, go-everywhere camera.	2012-01-09	2797	I love my GoPro HD but really hated the abbreviated text for the<br>modes and the possibility of missing a shot (and not finding out<br>til afterwards!).<br /><br />The LCD Bacpac comes with<br>additional doors for the clear GoPro case since the LCD Bacpac<br>obviously adds extra girth to the GoPro.<br /><br />After<br>clipping it on and attaching the new doors to your GoPro's clear<br>case, you're ready to go.

R1TWOK1L61TYF2	3	Worth the price?	I think this is the only option if you wish to fit your GoPro onto a tripod. The price is quite high for a small gadget like this. I still don't think this is worth its price. And it doesn't comes with a bolt, thus got to use the existing bolts that comes with the GoPro package.	2012-01-08	2798	I think this is the only option if you wish to fit your GoPro<br>onto a tripod.

R30YJ9HVUW1LEA	5	LCD backpack for Hero2	Great product and the infatuation with things GoProHero2 continues.  The device clips easily on my outdoor edition of camera and creates a LCD on the back of a very small sport camera...Outstanding...can't wait to see what they come up with next	2012-01-05	2801	Great product and the infatuation with things GoProHero2<br>continues.

R2DND619R20H68	3	No nut on this tiny thing	As I understood it, they started putting the nuts in the package, but mine definitely did not come with a nut.  Maybe the problem is with the packaging.  Like the nut falls out of the actual mount then it slips out of the plastic since it isn't sealed.  Not too happy that I need to go to the hardware store and get one.  I don't care about having to spend $.20 on a nut.  What I do care about is having to take the time to go to the store and buy something that should have been included.    Also this thing is really really small.  The little circular part that is on the right side of the default picture is about the size of a quarter or a nickle.  This thing probably costs about $.30-.40 to make.  There is no reason why it should cost $12.00.	2012-01-03	2803	As I understood it, they started putting the nuts in the<br>package, but mine definitely did not come with a nut.

R2TGTS6SFCFTPA	5	GoPro LCD Bacpac	A must have for navigating the camera menus. Sound quality is greater than I expected from the side speaker. The housings that come with it seem to hold it well.

RLA1HS4HP9WFG	5	No more videos of ground or sky....	Quick delivery as promised.  LCD Bacpac works perfect, so no longer concern & frustration about only having shot video of either ground or sky ;-)  Friendly advice - remember to update camera software prior to installing the bacpac otherwise it may not work. May be written in the IO, but did not realise that prior to test, so for a short while I worried that the bacpac did not work - but that was not the case.....

R3T0W8WL2XWD6R	5	Not as bulky as I thought	The LCD Bacpac turns the GoPro into a carry around video camera and helps with setup. No it isn't the highest image quality but who cares you aren't using it to focus or set exposure, the camera is full auto. Tremendously helpful for mounting so you know exactly what you get. I would recommend this over say the skeleton housing and an external monitor for sure. I don't know if I will take it off at this point.	2012-01-02	2804	The LCD Bacpac turns the GoPro into a carry around video camera<br>and helps with setup.

RDHWBXR9ONWPL	4	Glad to have it at least	Mine came with a nut, however it's not attached.<br />Lack of a bolt is really annoying because that means there's always one nut loose somewhere with the potential to get lost.<br />At the time of writing this, GoPro sells it cheaper.

R32GRMA0N57B83	4	New Tripod Mounts Come With Nut, Still Overpriced but Useful	I recently purchased the GoPro Tripod Mount for an HD Hero 2.  First of all, if you are ordering now, it includes the nut, so all the previous reviews saying it does not are now out of date.  However, after only a few uses, the nut came loose and I had to epoxy/crazy glue it into place.  This is a common problem across many GoPro mounts.  Because the tripod mount does not come with its own thumbscrew (you have to reuse the one that came with your camera or get one in the grab bag of mounts), if the nut falls off, you can easily lose it. Save yourself the headache and epoxy it down beforehand.  No frills, the mount is the same plastic as other mounts.  The bottom is pretty sturdy and has some texture on it as seen in the picture to provide more friction.  If you are using it with a small monopod such as the T-200L (which allows you to video yourself), you will need a bit of foam tape between the tripod mount and the head of the monopod.  I imagine this is more the fault of the T-200L than the GoPro, because with other better quality tripods and monopod connections, it is pretty solid.    Along with a monopod, it makes shooting video of yourself in a 360 degree fashion funny and very easy.  If you have a long enough monopod, you can barely see the monopod itself in the video.    I have also used this mount on a Hama car suction mount and it works prett well.    A lot of people have stated that this is overpriced, and I agree.  But it does open up a whole host of non-GoPro mount options in more traditional settings:  tripods, monopods, existing car mounts, Gorillapods, handheld stabilizers, professional suction cup mounts, etc. that you may already have or be able to buy for your specific application.  So bite the bullet, spend the $7 or so on this and open up your GoPro Hero or GoPro HD Hero 1/2 to all sorts of new fun.	2011-12-13	2824	I recently purchased the GoPro Tripod Mount for an HD Hero 2.<br>First of all, if you are ordering now, it includes the nut, so<br>all the previous reviews saying it does not are now out of date.<br>However, after only a few uses, the nut came loose and I had to<br>epoxy/crazy glue it into place.

R2U901GI1JWCV	1	They are amature cameras at best, for a price of professional!	Maybe the prototypes were really great, but somehow the final product has become a shadow of what was advertised. I work with wide spectrum of photo and video gear, such as Aiptek point-and-shoot, Canon SLRs, Sony, Hasselblad, Leaf digital backs, and others.    I used GoPro Hero2 recently. This does not seem to produce even 8 Megapixel shots at the appropriate settings (not mentioning 11 Megapixels)! Pixel noise is huge and color representation is poor. The color representation seems gray, flat, and dull... It is rather 20$ worth of production value, not a pro or semi-pro as advertised...    The results are not professional, as advertised. A 100$ camera I used previously for the last 4 years takes better pictures. Looks like if GoPro used different processors to shoot their beautiful commercials! Or did they do substantial corrections during editing of their broadcast videos we all fall in love with?     When the sensor on GoPro Hero2 gets warm (during battery charging), camera start to produce stripes and other artifacts, which don't go away if the camera is turned off and on again. This is the image on Flickr from my experience: [...] There are other images there too, showing my attempts to get the best out of this camera.    A lot of plastic parts that ship with the camera are merely discarded and never used again. Does it seem wasteful? The rigging does not allow to tilt the camera up, while on harness. Perhaps there are other rigging parts, which need to be purchased the moment camera arrives.    The wide angle is great. Unfortunately, and very disappointing, the real quality is nowhere near advertised.	2011-12-09	2828	Maybe the prototypes were really great, but somehow the final<br>product has become a shadow of what was advertised.

R8YGY4IM7YBR4	4	Having a view of what I am videoing	After using my GoPro for a year without really knowing what I was capturing this is an awesome add on. First time out it was great to work the camera like a regular camcorder with viewing while shooting. Play back was another plus once I figured out how to do it.   Cons: As always there are a few quirks, it took three times and a few trips on the internet to finally get the software update into the camera. I really wonder who came up with an instruction book that is BLACK With WHITE lettering that is so small I could not read it with my bifocals????? I guess someone has a weird sense of humor, it is easier to go online and read the instructions and also there are a couple of kind people that made videos on YouTube to show all you need to know.	2011-12-09	2828	After using my GoPro for a year without really knowing what I<br>was capturing this is an awesome add on.

R1MKLSQ6L0AI4Y	5	completes the story	Bought the camera almost a year ago to film some motorbike and skiing trips - worked perfectly, but sometimes it was difficult to adjust the camera to get the right picture - and trial and error was a bit nasty (no laptop on the bike). So the screen really helps here - it does not really effects the weight and as well the size is still small.

RLNY5420F1JUL	5	Makes the GoPro how it should have been from the start!	I have been using my GoPro at all of my recent track days and have found it to be a great little tool, but I admittedly had issues aiming it perfectly.  A buddy of mine got me one of these for my birthday and I must say it is a great little piece.  I love the live view and end up actually using so much more of my footage because I already know what it looks like and can adjust preemptively.  I did have to download a new firmware version onto the card, but it took about 20 seconds and then I was up and running.    Summary:  Easy to use and setup  Comes with a ton of backpieces that allow for use of every housing  High end camera = higher accessory prices, but I can say that it is worth every penny of the amazon price of ~$80  Great for track days with multiple cars because it will allow us to quickly bounce the camera between cars and still have well aimed footage	2011-11-07	2860	I have been using my GoPro at all of my recent track days and<br>have found it to be a great little tool, but I admittedly had<br>issues aiming it perfectly.

R2NXEA9XSB81M5	5	Pricey, but adds a lot of flexibility	This adapter is light, compact but a little expensive.  It includes the nut and the plastic mount. There's a stainless threaded insert in the base for the tripod head screw (1/4 20) - the same thread on the bottom of most cameras.  You can fabricate your own mounts using this to connect any variety or items. One of the most popular uses is to mount this on inexpensive egg/kitchen timers and use it as a 360 rotation base to create really cool time lapse movies. This really should be 1/2 the price, but GoPro has it retailing for 8 bucks. So if you want this expandability you're stuck paying the price. I have three of them.	2011-10-31	2867	This adapter is light, compact but a little expensive.  It<br>includes the nut and the plastic mount.

R2DW8I7MVDMI15	3	Skips playback of movies taken in 3D sync mode	Good:  This LCD works great for checking to make sure your camera is aimed correctly.  It has full text for each menu option on the display rather than just the 3 letters per menu option on the front.  Bad:  Skips playback of movies taken in 3D sync mode.  I'm guessing since the folders are named differently for 3D vs 2D it doesn't pick them up for playback.  It should be a simple firmware fix.  You can't use the extra battery backpack and LCD at the same time so your camera is going to use batteries even faster.  Expensive compared to the cost of the camera.	2011-10-16	2882	Good:  This LCD works great for checking to make sure your<br>camera is aimed correctly.

R1GXSE4E8FYIR7	3	Missing go pro camera lock nut	Like other reviewers, I am disappointed that this item cost so much and is missing a nut.  The acorn nut used to secure the go pro camera to the tripod mount is missing.  Its included in all the other accessories I have bought.  I had to go to a hardware store and get 5Mx0.8 nuts for about a dollar.  The hardware store didn't have acorn nuts only the regular kind.  Thankfully they weren't stupid enough to forget the tripod nut at the bottom.	2011-10-16	2882	Like other reviewers, I am disappointed that this item cost so<br>much and is missing a nut.

R2N2HW6G1FHENL	4	Comes with nut now	I got mine recently and it came with the nut for 1/4 20 that people said was missing before.<br /><br />The only downside I would mention is that the surface that meets the tripod place is hard plastic and does not have a second alignment hole (as many tripods and plates support) So in the end it means only friction is holding it to the tripod screw or plate.	2011-10-16	2882	I got mine recently and it came with the nut for 1/4 20 that<br>people said was missing before.<br /><br />The only downside I<br>would mention is that the surface that meets the tripod place is<br>hard plastic and does not have a second alignment hole (as many<br>tripods and plates support) So in the end it means only friction<br>is holding it to the tripod screw or plate.

R1WGCAU94PUQGP	2	Good Product while you are getting rip off by GoPro.	This is basically a piece of plastic for $8. After you receive it, you still have to run to the freaking hardware store to hunt down a nut that would work with it. For those you don't know what I am talking about, it is the nut and bolt that go through the mount connecting to the GoPro mount. Not the nut for the tripod.  I was highly disappointed with this but there are no other ways to get something that fits inside a tripod and can be securely tight down to anywhere you have a fitting nut to go into the thread for the tripod.  This does add versatility to you go pro. For example, I didn't get the goPro Motor sports version, but have a suction cup GPS mount from a TomTom a while ago. So I drill a hole, superglue down a nut, and that go mounted on my windshield. Save me $25 from buying another ripoff windshield mount.  Same can be done with handle bar mount, helmet front mount, etc. I would recommend picking this up so you don't have to pick for more stupid mounts from goPro.   I bought the goPro Naked and this mount, with another order on the way (bag of mounts), I just paid over $300 for a tiny little video camera that does not even have an LCD...  I may change my mine and go with Contour instead while my return window is still open.	2011-10-07	2891	This is basically a piece of plastic for $8.

RPRJ6W25TSG4P	4	Useful addition to camera	While it would have been nice for this to be much thinner and come with the GoPro Hero 1080p, the fact that it can be added makes it a no brainer. Without the monitor back you have to rely on the cryptic numbers on the LCD of the camera for correct modes. WIth the monitor back, it is very obvious which mode the camera is in and while its still cumbersome to change modes, it's much easier to see the changes happening in real time.<br /><br />I can't tell how much battery power it eats, but recently did get over 1:45 of video in continuous shot from the camera  with the back attached (although it falls asleep if you don't press any buttons)	2011-10-06	2892	While it would have been nice for this to be much thinner and<br>come with the GoPro Hero 1080p, the fact that it can be added<br>makes it a no brainer.

R3347CD41U7J6R	5	Use this all the time	I use the LCD screen a lot. It makes the GoPro so much easier to use in so many ways. The big thing is the menu system is much easier to use with this attached. Its still not the best menu interface but much easier then trying to use the LED screen on the front of the camera wich just gives you codes for everything. This screen actually gives you words and pictures so you can tell what your doing without having to have the instructions with you or remembering what every code means. Its also real nice to be able to see what the camera is seeing when your using it as a regular camera instead of mounting it. Its also very handy in getting the right angles when mounting it to something such as a helmet. Its very common for people to have the camera angled too far down or up so all you see is the ground or sky. Once I use it to get the exact angle I want I make marks on the mounts so I can always find that sweet spot again without the need of the screen. I usually always just leave the screen on but if I'm doing a long shoot then I sometimes have the extra battery attached and you can only have one or the other attached at a time. It would be kind of nice to be able to attach both but at the same time that would just make the camera very bulky and heavy. I also love being able to see my shoots instantly with this LCD screen instead of waiting till I'm at a computer. Very nice when whoever being filmed busts a great trick or line and want to see how it looked or make sure you got it in frame and the angle you wanted. This LCD screed is a must for the GoPro HD. Just remember this only works with the Hero HD. The older models of the GoPro do not have the expansion port on the back of the camera.	2011-09-25	2903	I use the LCD screen a lot.

R2EV6WR7VWOH8T	5	Works well but might be a waste of money	I love the camera.  I use it to video all my personal dives and work dives. (I dive for the State Police) I figured I would need the LCD to see what I was filming.  If you use it for stationary or a fixed mounted position where you are behind the camera I guess definitely get it.  I use it on a helmet attachment so I have found that it is pretty useless.  I can't see whats on the LCD when its on my head so you just have to guesstimate where it is aimed for filming.  I find that because of the huge viewing angle of the camera it is better to aim a little low because at least you get most of what your looking at.  One dive it was a little high and we were spear fishing.  I shot two good size stripers and a tautog and only videoed the water about 3 feet higher than the fish so I had 2 hours of ocean water recorded.  Plus I never use it to view what I videoed, I always put it on my laptop or big screen tv.  Plus the camera is not good for photos unless you are very close to what your shooting.  And by close I mean like 4 to 5 feet.  When I first got it I took a picture of my kids from about 10 feet out and it looked like 40 because of the wide viewing angle.  The added width of the camera with the LCD screen on it also makes some of the mounts useless.  I can't tilt the camera all the way up with the LCD on because the poly case hits the mount.  I gave it 5 stars because it works well just not for what I use it for, maybe get the camera and try it out then decide on the LCD.	2011-09-21	2907	I love the camera.

R2F7JNJ57O5QS6	4	youll like it and use it. but you dont need it	i wouldnt consider this a necessity, but it definitely enhances the gopro experience being able to review on the fly. having this on for a few months also made aiming my gopro without it MUCH easier. i sometimes find myself having it off due to using the headstrap, but popping it out of the case and taking the LCD bacpac out of my bag to check that last video. it does add a substantial amount of weight and size to the camera and that should be noted.

R2RP4JAE9E5BRM	4	Will avoid the guessing game of filming	"I'm in videography & photography and I just can't allow myself to gamble in recording great moments & once in a lifetime shots.

R3I14MP3FBQ2ZC	1	Piece of Junk broke and I lost my camera	My big problem occured this weekend. The mount for my camera broke this weekend on our race car. My camera is now gone forever. Only used it 4 times. After seeing that the mount broke I checked my rear camera and mount. The camera was still there but the mount was broken as well. Almost lost that one too. I notified other people in pit around me of the problem and one other guy lost his camera too the exact same way. Another found his mount is cracked too.     Horrible job for GoPro here. Wasted money!	2011-08-30	2929	My big problem occured this weekend. The mount for my camera<br>broke this weekend on our race car. My camera is now gone<br>forever. Only used it 4 times.

R6JIB73L2YCI5	4	Unsung hero	GoPro should be packaging these with every Hero.

R28TGF8PJPXD0	5	Roll Bar mount goes above and beyond.	The GoPro Roll bar mount has been the most versatile of my go pro accessories. It was my best solution for an interior shot  from a drivers POV when mounted on a racing seat cage, I've also quickly attached it to a found hiking stick and it became a great impromptu boom/stabilizer. I've yet to attach it to an actual roll bar. Be wary that one screw is fixed into the mount while the other can uncouple from both halves of the mount as soon as it is loosened.	2011-07-31	2959	The GoPro Roll bar mount has been the most versatile of my go<br>pro accessories.

R2CC7WZGGGUSWY	5	An excellent addition to the variety of mounts for my GoPro	First, this cost me $7.99 at Best Buy and it just made too much sense to not buy it from there. The mount came with the nut some people are complaining about not getting but perhaps its because GoPro listened to their customers and began including it or fixed whatever manufactoring issue was occurring. Don't know.    As far using this, I did not use it to attach my GoPro to a tripod. Instead I screwed a Ram mount with a treaded stud onto the other side of this adapter piece and now I am able to use any Ram Mount with my GoPro. I sometimes ride my motorcycle with a GPS mounted to my triple tree with a Ram Mount. Now I can utilize the GoPro in that location which is good because theres really no good place to mount the camera anywhere else on my triple. This little guy is worth it's weight in gold because the Ram Mounts do not allow for any movement when you have the pieces tightened down well and you can angle it quite well.	2011-07-22	2968	First, this cost me $7.99 at Best Buy and it just made too much<br>sense to not buy it from there.

R1MPZWIQS84T4Q	1	First time I used this mount...	The first use of this mount was on Sunday River downhill biking.  I had the thing perfectly secure (used screw driver) mounted to my bike frame.  It was mounted from behind where I could not see it. At the bottom of the EASY trail it was missing.  The plastic had snapped off this mount, and it wasnt even a joint where screws were, it was in the middle of an adjustment arm.  It took 2 runs looking and we finally spotted the camera while on the lift from above before our third walk through.  Huge waste of good biking time.  I am angry for GoPro charging $30 for a PLASTIC mount.  This thing cost no more than $1 in materials and for $30 I expect something that wont break on its first use.  MAKE THESE THINGS OUT OF METAL PLEASE. I almost lost a $300 camera and 16GB SD card using OEM/Brand name accessories, that is embarrassing how cheap this thing is based on how GoPro advertises it.	2011-07-17	2973	The first use of this mount was on Sunday River downhill biking.<br>I had the thing perfectly secure (used screw driver) mounted to<br>my bike frame.

R34AGT4IPFHNV6	1	Great product but the package is criminal.	There are several reviews of this screen, many detailing how fantastic it is. I agree that it's a wonderful addition to the GoPro camera but the packaging, as with the GoPro camera, is irresponsible. I'm giving the screen a single star to highlight this wasteful decision by the maker.    I'm a designer and have created a lot of packaging in my career. I woud have refused to use this style package for GoPro products. While I understand the desire to make products seen when on the shelf this is unacceptable and unsustainable use of resources.	2011-07-03	2987	There are several reviews of this screen, many detailing how<br>fantastic it is.

R1XZNF105BAV6S	5	Finally a GoPro HERO Improvement!	Finally a GoPro HERO Improvement!  My #1 complaint about the GoPro HERO camera has always been it lousy front facing LCD screen.  I've seen $3 watches with better screens.  Now the menu items are easy to read as you scroll through them.  No more memorizing the tiny symbols that occupy the front facing LCD screen.  Also it's nice to have a live view and playback option right there on the camera.  One negative is the noticble increase in weight when wearing this as a helmet cam, but I will take it given the increase in functionality.  Also it comes with 4 new rear covers.  IMO the camera is somewhat useless without this accessory.  The new firmware upgrade is great too.	2011-07-03	2987	Finally a GoPro HERO Improvement!

R2L5O2L63A909T	5	My GoPro HD Hero is now complete!	I was up to speed with my LCD BacPac less than a half-hour after the FedEx guy brought it to my door - and that includes time spent downloading and installing the firmware upgrade to my GoPro HD Hero camera. If you pay attention and watch the online videos, it an absolute no-brainer. To those of us who are comfortable with computers and tech stuff, the firmware upgrade is routine and only a mild inconvenience. (I'm belaboring this point because the guy who gave the LCD BacPac only one star seems to think GoPro should have made the LCD screen ready to go right out of the box - never mind that the LCD back wasn't created when the original firmware was written.)  That said, the LCD back is the feature that was missing from the GoPro package. Now I can be sure I have my videos properly framed and I can play them back in the field, without having to drag a computer along to make sure I got the shots I wanted.  Yes, it drains battery, so you need to use it judiciously. It has a timed shutoff in case you forget to turn off the LCD. But the trade-off is that the LCD makes it more likely you'll get what you want the first time and won't have to burn battery or your time re-shooting. That's especially important if your non-LCD option is traveling miles to your home to view what you shot and then having to travel miles back to the shooting location for a re-do, assuming that's even possible.  I'm also impressed that the LCD BacPac is only about $70. I bought mine about two minutes after I discovered it on Amazon.com - a killer deal that required no internal debate.  The bottom line: if you have a GoPro HD Hero camera, you need this add-on.	2011-06-24	2996	I was up to speed with my LCD BacPac less than a half-hour after<br>the FedEx guy brought it to my door - and that includes time<br>spent downloading and installing the firmware upgrade to my<br>GoPro HD Hero camera.

Great fit with the GoPro and really makes it a totally different experience when recording, as you now can see how you frame the shoot instead of hoping it is good.

I had to upgrade the firmware in<br>my GoPro to get it to recognize the LCD, but that was just as<br>easy as putting on the LCD. GoPro have made a great job in<br>making this process as smooth as possible. The LCD makes the<br>best sports camera even better.

RADCV0S74CGYJ	5	Excellent Purchase	I'm very happy that I bought the LCD Bacpac for my GoPro because, even though it is a little bit more bulky, I already used it during my trip when I need it t film a portion knowing where to aim and how t would like in the movie.  I also wore it on my head when doing a zip line and didn't mind the extra weight and was able to aim the camera right and afterwards turn it off for the rest of the filming so it wouldn't consume more battery life.	2011-04-30	3051	I'm very happy that I bought the LCD Bacpac for my GoPro<br>because, even though it is a little bit more bulky, I already<br>used it during my trip when I need it t film a portion knowing<br>where to aim and how t would like in the movie.

RUYZNQZ6JQ1RO	5	Put your GoPro on a tripod	I decided to use my GoPro in connection with my other view cameras for getting a different angle on photo shoots.

R1IZSF419QB39C	3	Good Product, but gets real hot!	The GoPro LED is a vast improvement over having no way to review. You can now view your HD Videos in the field with sound. There is a button to turn it on & off, and the housing backs have a button actuator. You get 2 housing backs that accommodate the thicker profile. (1 Waterproof & 1 Skeleton). You also get 2 housing backs for the Wrist Housing. (1 Waterproof & 1 Skeleton).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After using this LCD screen device for a while, I have noticed a bad point. This thing gets seriously hot! ...And that relates to a severe battery drain.<br />Yes, you can turn it off once you have framed your shoot, and that's good, but when it's in the case, that's not really possible. (maybe with the skeleton case).<br /><br />If I could return this for a full refund, I would.	2011-04-28	3053	The GoPro LED is a vast improvement over having no way to<br>review.

R3U6LJFK7TVL2S	1	Gouging at its worst	Buying this item is like paying your doctor to check for hemorrhoids. You're not going to like it, but you've got no other choice. The tripod mount is functional, but incomplete. In fact, it's useless as you receive it. You'll need to add your own nut and bolt to make it work at all. Yes, you have these from when you bought the camera, but heaven forbid that GoPro reduce their profit by a few cents and give you another set so you can actually use this thing.<br /><br />Grin and bear it, that's all you can do.	2011-04-25	3056	Buying this item is like paying your doctor to check for<br>hemorrhoids.

RZEKHU5XIRLC	3	Doesn't come with the nut... and a little overpriced.	Do yourself a favor, and buy a couple of 5mm Hex Nut caps from your local hardware store (my Home Depot had them in packs of 2 for ~ 50 cents, you'll find them in some drawers in the hardware section).  The mount doesn't come with the bolt (but you can use the one you already have), but real issue is that it doesn't come with the nut, which all the other mounts have (hence the previous recommendation).  Including this nut would have saved me the trouble of going to a hardware store, and getting it on my own.  Although, you could probably pull it off one of your other mounts, but that is more of a hassle to pull that tiny thing off, and risk dropping it and losing it.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems like it will be pretty decent.  Pretty overpriced for a plastic adapter to convert it to a tripod mount. It'll definitely do the job, but could have been more handy with the nut, and cheaper would have been better too.	2011-04-20	3061	Do yourself a favor, and buy a couple of 5mm Hex Nut caps from<br>your local hardware store (my Home Depot had them in packs of 2<br>for ~ 50 cents, you'll find them in some drawers in the hardware<br>section).

RZOD6237ZGZX9	1	Missing the nut, couldn't mount camera	Got the go-pro from one seller, the extra battery from another. Both worked out great. The tripod mount I intended to use on the roll bar mount in my race car. It was from Amazon LLC. Of course, they're the one without a seller rating. The tripod mount didn't have a nut on it, but I didn't discover that until I unwrapped it at the track. Useless. Waste of $$$.     Maybe yours will come with one, and you'll actually get to use it.	2011-04-12	3069	Got the go-pro from one seller, the extra battery from another.<br>Both worked out great.

R1MP4T2OS9E72Q	4	Does what it needs to do...	First off, the only reason I gave it 4 as oppose to 5 is simply the price.

It's just that you can't have HUGE expectations for this LCD. It does everything I expected it to do and more. The camera needed this big time. It's easy to aim now and see if the camera is on from the back view.<br /><br />The LCD is bright enough to see in daylight. At the beach on a really sunny day it may be a little tough. Brightness is adjustable though, and shading it helps. It is really not any worse than my compact camera with a much bigger screen.<br /><br />No more cryptic settings menu! I love being able to see the settings menu on it. As people have said the menu is spelled out clearly and easy to understand. This is something I didn't expect and is certainly one of it's strongpoints.<br /><br />The price doesn't bother me at all. It is pretty much where I expected it to be.<br /><br />I like this LCD!

R34WF2K1GZPWL5	1	Steer clear	Why oh why do we pay for a brand new camera & its sent with instructions for the end user to upgrade the firmware to be able to use the rear LCD. By the way you will need to download the firmware as well.    Do you see canon/samsung/sony/nikon do this ? Just letting people know that they are not buying a working unit. YOU need to get it working, i cannot believe a company in 2011 is running its operation like this. That said, the firmware update crashed my camera so badly it needed to be sent back for replacement anyway & if you google this you will see many many others are left with the same problem. Gopro have you considered selling a working unit in the first place ?    Poor job Gopro, i bet this rushed new HD LCD has made you realise that you need to wait for a product to be fit for sale BEFORE you send it into the market place.	2011-03-17	3095	Why oh why do we pay for a brand new camera & its sent with<br>instructions for the end user to upgrade the firmware to be able<br>to use the rear LCD.

REZ2CP9TF2S6P	5	The perfect add on for a  Go-Pro camera!	"I found the LCD screen to be quite clear even though it is small.  This BacPak does add about 1/2\\"" of additional bulk to the camera, so if weight or size is an issue, then it can be easily removed and used with out.    What I really like about it is that the menu system displays now on the BacPac LCD in real words instead of only those cryptic letters on the front LCD screen  That is a big plus in my opinion!    As far as battery life, the screen can easily be shut off in order to conserve battery life.    I really do like the flexibility of now being able to view pictures and videos immediately instead of having to wait to access a computer.  This can make a BIG difference between getting the shot you are looking for instead of a shot of the sky or ground!    As a final comment, make sure you install the new firmware BEFORE trying to use the BacPak.

R2GRSYZG6HCKWH	4	LCD Bacpak	This makes the GoPro camera complete in my opinion. Without a viewfinder you are shooting blind. Granted if it's mounted on your head, you'll need a friend. However I have my GoPro cameras mounted in our machinery to video our work. We use the skeleton backs so we can run a power cord for constant power. Without the bacpak, you don't know how your shots are framed or if the camera is recording. A great feature and may be reason enough to buy this is that the menu appears in plain english on the LCD screen. No more cryptic messages on that tiny screen on the front of the camera. Like anything else, it fits a need but not everyone will need this accessory.	2011-03-13	3099	This makes the GoPro camera complete in my opinion. Without a<br>viewfinder you are shooting blind.

R1EZXELNRZB3TL	5	Not always needed, but very cool when it is	Most of the time I'm using my GoPro, I only use the LCD for setting up shots or shot angles, but I always use it when I'm handheld shooting.  You know what you're framing and can quickly adjust to get some really cool perspectives.  Unless I'm handheld shooting, I usually set it to turn off a minute after the last button press in case i forget to turn it off myself.  You can also adjust the brightness if you need to.  I wind up using it a bunch to review pictures and videos too.  It has a speaker, so you can hear the audio track.  For whatever reason, most of my friends dig the instant gratification of checking out something that just happened, and now we can do just that.	2011-03-10	3102	Most of the time I'm using my GoPro, I only use the LCD for<br>setting up shots or shot angles, but I always use it when I'm<br>handheld shooting.

R1H1NX5BTM5PQ1	4	Nice little adapter....	This little adapter is great for mounting the GoPro onto a monopod or a tripod.  The neat part of the monopod is that you can use it to put the camera in an unreachable place (such as over the edge of a lookout, out the door of a plane before a parachute jump or out the window of a moving vehicle).    I think that $7.99 is a too much, but there is no other easy and quick way to mount to a monopod or tripod.  I think this should be included with the camera itself as the actual price to the company is probably around $.50 as it is one piece and no moving parts.    All in all, it is a well used and most used item in my GoPro accessory arsenal.	2011-03-07	3105	This little adapter is great for mounting the GoPro onto a<br>monopod or a tripod.

To use it on a horizontal bar, you have to attach two extension arms, which result in increased vibration and camera wobble.    For the most vibration and wobble free video from a horizontal rollbar like you find inside a car, get the $8[[ASIN:B002RCLYXG GoPro Tripod Mount for HERO Cameras]] instead, and attach it to the rollbar using a [[ASIN:B00009R6BK Bogen - Manfrotto Super Clamp with Standard Stud]].	2011-03-02	3110	This is great for attaching the camera to a vertical bar, but<br>not so great for a horizontal roll bar unless you want to mount<br>the camera sideways.

R1MVUZEEO4CN1A	3	Not that Great	It's really small, hard to see in daylight,uses a lot of battery power and has limited uses. expensive.    Good points , GoPro does give you new back cases for the increase is size, I find that the best use is to see where you are filming than turn off the LCD to save power.    I use the GoPro HD on my Motorcycle & inside my car, so the LCD  may be be more useful depending on how you use it.	2011-03-01	3111	It's really small, hard to see in daylight,uses a lot of battery<br>power and has limited uses. expensive.

R2MIK5YB5QSV1Z	4	Neat add-on, but needs to include a nut	I used this to attach my GoPro to an telescoping rod while snowboarding.  It worked great, but I had to steal a nut from a different mount to use with this one.  It really should come with one in my opinion, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the mount.	2011-02-03	3137	I used this to attach my GoPro to an telescoping rod while<br>snowboarding.

R31J55ITBN73ZZ	5	Must have.	The GoPro comes with a lot of mounts and accessories for certain shooting conditions, but every now and then I just want to stick on a tripod and let it be. If you get a GoPro, spend a little extra on this. It might not seem useful at first, but soon you'll realize how much you needed in the first place.	2011-01-26	3145	The GoPro comes with a lot of mounts and accessories for certain<br>shooting conditions, but every now and then I just want to stick<br>on a tripod and let it be.

R34E5L13N19WJW	1	Beware Tripod Adapter w/o nut	The fact that i had to buy this $8 piece of plastic to mount to a tripod is extremely annoying i think it should have been included with the camera. My second complaint is the fact that the mount comes with no nut so you can mount it.With out this nut this adapter is completely useless. All the other accessories come standard with this nut but for some reason this one does not, WHY?! Now i have to go scramble thru my spare parts to see if i have one that fits if not then i have to take a trip to the hardware store. Complete waste of time.	2011-01-22	3149	The fact that i had to buy this $8 piece of plastic to mount to<br>a tripod is extremely annoying i think it should have been<br>included with the camera.

R2F31B950N6NJ5	4	Does what its supposed to do but way overpriced.	For some reason GoPro believes this little jewel is worth it's weight in gold because that's about what they charge for it.  And I wouldn't object so much but it even doesn't come with a nut.  Adding a nut might raise their total production costs all the way up to what, 15 cents maybe.  So at nearly eight bucks, the price is totally absurd.  But then again, it's the same will all their accessories.  They sell the camera cheap and then stick you for the accessories you need to get the most out of it.<br /><br />Edit: Since the original review, GoPro has seen the error in their ways and is now including a nut.  In response, upped rating to 4 stars.  Still shouldn't be more than five bucks though.	2010-10-15	3248	For some reason GoPro believes this little jewel is worth it's<br>weight in gold because that's about what they charge for it.<br>And I wouldn't object so much but it even doesn't come with a<br>nut.

R7TOYRG1TF615	1	Excellent product, but total rip-off	There is nothing wrong with this little piece of metal and plastic-- it is great.  But the fact that I had to pay for it and that it didn't come included with the camera and mounts is a total rip-off.  When you spend $300 for a camera, you don't want to later be charged several bucks (and possibly shipping) for a little piece like this.  It should be INCLUDED!<br /><br />FYI, this mount and a Gorilla pod with ball mount make an excellent combo for adding versatility to the Hero camera system.	2010-09-23	3270	There is nothing wrong with this little piece of metal and<br>plastic-- it is great.

R10UUH1NRVWCQ8	5	Does what it's designed to do. Too expensive.	I had planned to deduct 2 stars based on the fact that you need to buy an $8 accessory JUST TO PUT THE FREAKING CAMERA ON A TRIPOD. But I reconsidered. I mean, this thing does in fact provide the ability to mount the Hero on any tripod or other mounting device using a 1/4x20 threaded stud. This adds considerable flexibility to the already excellent mounting options that ship with the cameras. I still say the camera should have had a built in tripod mount though.	2010-09-17	3276	I had planned to deduct 2 stars based on the fact that you need<br>to buy an $8 accessory JUST TO PUT THE FREAKING CAMERA ON A<br>TRIPOD.

R2ZGLNQR0AU29P	3	From a professional	I was annoyed this accessory came without a nut. It's a small complaint but borrowing a nut from my other hardware results in fumbling with tiny parts easily dropped and lost.

RQ0KKZSXEJ7SQ	4	Handle bar mount for GoPro	Nice mount, could be a LOT better though. I lost one of the mounting screws somehow and there are no replacement parts, had to buy the whole thing again.

R2TM0N0CAXDXDJ	3	It's OK.	If you have a roll bar and a HERO cam, you need this.  If you are at all creative, build your own.      The GoPro mount is difficult to install, often won't fit or get the camera close enough to the window to prevent a washed-out image.  The thumbscrews are too bulky to really be useful, small knurled metal ones would have been a better choice.  The mount does work OK as far as sturdiness for sportscar racing, although it doesn't take much to move it around.  One really annoying thing is that you may find yourself having to rearrange the mount to get the latch and door open on the protective case whenever you want to take out the camera.      If I could do it over again, I would save the $30 and cobble something together from two hose clamps and the base of the camera packaging that takes the quick-release mount.      This roll bar mount should be priced at about 6.95 for what you get.  I hope GoPro revises this product soon.	2010-06-24	3361	If you have a roll bar and a HERO cam, you need this.

RIXHUMF4Z4Z24	2	Too flimsy for practical use	This is a flimsy and not well thought out design. Two major problems:    1) Too flimsy. It is made of plastic that bends and stresses when you tighten in down. The cushion rubber pads are lifting after 2 uses because the glue is coming loose. I use it on  boat and it does get exposed to water. But the camera was made for harsh condition so the mounts should be too    2) Both screw closures are not fixed. In other words while attaching or detaching the mount one of the screws comes off (can completely detach) and if you drop it and lose it your mount is useless.     I always use a lanyard if my camera can be damaged or lost by a mount failure.	2010-05-11	3405	This is a flimsy and not well thought out design. Two major<br>problems:    1) Too flimsy.
